Any block in scala can return value and ""if"" is no exception. So, in more ""idiomatic"" approach you will try to avoid any mutators / ""actions"". Instead, you will start using if for computing things. Thus, having something like this:<br />val x = if (cond) fun1(a, b, c) else fun2(a, b, c)<br />In such cases, not having {} is a blessing. And even in the example you provided, it would be pretty much clear that action3 was not meant to be a part of else block, if your if had something to return(primarily because action3 would most likely have a totally different type).<br /><br />Overall, I agree that sometimes {} are needed, so that the code is easier to read(e.g. your action1/action2 can be if on its own).

265,71,"Week 1 FAQ","092bc1e4148464ffc0d7a5a84f77b484",1410889070,-1,0,0,1,0,0,0,16,"<p>This is a FAQ from previous versions of the class. Some information <i>could</i> be out-of-date.</p>
<p><b>Is there a limit on a number of submissions?</b>
</p>
<p>Yes. We're only allowed five submissions before the grades stop counting towards the effective score for the assignment.</p>
<p><a href=""https://class.coursera.org/progfun-005/wiki/view?page=GradingPolicy"">https://class.coursera.org/progfun-004/wiki/view?page=GradingPolicy</a>
</p>
<p><b>How do I compute the elements of Pascal's triangle?</b>
</p>
<p>There's a nifty animation on Wikipedia's page for Pascal's triangle, right next to the table of contents:</p>
<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_triangle"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_triangle</a>
</p>
<p>Note that you <i>should not</i> compute the elements of the triangle using other formulae for binomial coefficients. Grader may rely on certain behavior specific to this particular way to implement this function.</p>
<p><b>What should I do in <code>pascal()</code> if <code>c &gt; r</code>?</b>
</p>
<p>Grader will not complain if you return zero in that case.</p>
<p><b>What exactly does it mean for a string to be balanced?</b>
</p>
<p>A string with no parentheses in it is balanced. Any given opening parenthesis is balanced if and only if there's a closing parenthesis to the right of it such that the expression between them is also balanced. Any given closing parenthesis is balanced
    if and only if there's an opening parenthesis to the left of it such that the expression between them is also balanced. An expression is balanced if and only if all of the parentheses in it are balanced.</p>
<p>Note that this does not give you an immediate solution for the problem - you should think about it a little.</p>
<p><b>What does CHF stand for?</b>
</p>
<p>It's the currency symbol for Swiss franc.</p>
<p><b>How many ways are there to change 0 CHF?</b>
</p>
<p>One way - using no coins at all. No, you cannot give no coins if asked for 14 CHF - sum of an empty sequence of numbers is 0, not 14.</p>
<p><b>What do all those <code>isEmpty</code>, <code>head</code> and <code>tail</code> methods actually do?</b>
</p>
<p>Give them a shot in <code>sbt</code> console or Scala worksheet.</p>
<p><b>Should my solution be runnable?</b>
</p>
<p>Yes. <code>run</code> in <code>sbt</code> should produce a simple representation of Pascal's triangle.</p>
<p><b>Should I use just what we learned in the class so far?</b>
</p>
<p>Generally speaking, yes. Graders are known to check the code for using certain features in at least some cases. Besides, it's a good idea anyway.</p>
<p><b>Should I handle edge/corner cases?</b>
</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the assignment instructions tend to tell us whenever we need to do something specific about ""weird"" inputs. In all other cases you may assume the inputs are valid.</p>
<p><b>Should I make my solutions tail-recursive?</b>
</p>
<p>No. The grader will be perfectly happy with solutions that do not use tail recursion.</p>
<p><b>Can I make my solutions tail-recursive?</b>
</p>
<p>Yes, you can make pretty much anything tail-recursive. Simple tail-recursion takes the form of:</p>
<pre><code>def f(current_state: StateType): StateType =
  if (exit_condition(current_state))
    current_state
  else
    f(make_new_state(current_state))
f(initial_state)</code></pre>
<p>and is equivalent to the following imperative approach (in pseudo-code):</p>
<pre><code>current_state := initial_state
while not exit_condition(current_state) do
    mutate_state(current_state)
end</code></pre>
<p>Anything that can be computed one of these two ways can also be computed the other way (in fact, the transformation from one to the other is purely mechanical). You may convice yourself that anything computable can be computed iteratively by considering
    the Universal Turing Machine - which is certainly an iterative process.</p>
<p>But the question you should be asking yourself is whether making your solution tail-recursive gave you any benefit. If making a function tail-recursive requires passing a lot of state as a parameter, you're trading off stack space for heap space, which
    may or may not be useful, depending on the situation. For example, writing tree traversal in tail-recursive form is no rocket science, but it's usually an exercise in pointlessness, unless your stack space is extremely constrained, while heap space
    is abundant.</p>
<p><b>Why am I not supposed to use <code>var</code>? I need mutable state.</b>
</p>
<p>You can have mutable state without mutable variables. See the example in the previous question - it has ""mutable"" state, but all functions remain referentially transparent (i.e., they always produce the same result given the same inputs).</p>
<p><b>My solution passes all of provided unit tests, but the grader complains about it.</b>
</p>
<p>Unit tests provided with the assignment do not cover all of the cases. In fact, writing your own test cases is part of the assignment. And with the limit on a number of submissions it's a crucial part of it.</p>
<p><b>I don't get <code>if .. else</code> - it doesn't quite do what I expected.</b>
</p>
<p><code>if .. else</code> is not equivalent to <code>if .. else</code> <i>statements</i> in imperative programming languages. It's an expression, which means it has a type and always evaluates to a value, so it closer to ternary operator (<code>?:</code>)
    in C-like languages or <code>foo if bar else baz</code> in Python.</p>
<p>The type of any <code>if</code> expression is the least common ancestor of the types of its branches (we'll learn more about Scala's type system later in the class). While we're using proper <code>if .. else</code> expressions, where the types of expressions
    in both branches are the same, that reduces to ""<code>if</code> expression has the same type as its branches"". <code>if</code> without an explicit <code>else</code> clause still has it, implicitly, but its type is <code>AnyVal</code>, and so is the
    type of the entire <code>if</code> expression in this case.</p>
<p><b>What's wrong with using <code>return</code>?</b>
</p>
<p>A ton of things, perhaps the scariest being the fact that it doesn't respect the boundaries of anonymous functions.</p>
<p>But perhaps more importantly, if you're thinking in terms of <code>return</code>, you're doing something wrong. Most if not all of your function definitions should consist of a single expression (perhaps with some auxiliary definitions). This expression
    may be quite involved, but it will always evaluate to something - and that something will be ""returned"" by your function.</p>
<p><b>What's the best way to enforce preconditions in my functions?</b>
</p>
<p>It depends, but <code>require</code> is great.</p>",NA,NA,NA

Any time you add a value that is not on the head of the list you can never add the current head again.  That way you will get 1+1+1+1, then 1+1+2 and 2+2 and 1+3 but not 2+1+1 or 3+1(when change == 4).  So one you add the 2 the only working set left in your list is (2,3).<br /><br />I don't want to explain the whole algorithm but this should help!<br /><br />edit: adding some description<br />",NA,NA,NA

<ol><li><p>The main tradeoff between call-by-value and call-by-need, though as I would prefer to call them direct evaluation vs lazy evaluation, is that the language needs to set some things in place to make lazy evaluation work. Intuitively what a language in lazy evaluation mode would need to do is create a ""box"" that would eventually hold the value of the computation, and when that value is asked to know what computation it needs to do to fill in the box. Or to put it simply, the language needs to replace an access to a variable with a ""look at a cache. If value is there use it, else compute it, cache it and return it"".<br />So the main tradeoff is that lazy evaluation makes accessing the values a bit slower when you do end up needing the values. How much of an issue it is depends on how expensive the computation is, how ""thick"" the lazyness layers are, and how likely you are to need the value. One of the problems in my view is that, unless this is built into the language so that it's all over the place by default like Haskell, it's often hard for the ""user"" of the expensive computation to know that it is in fact an expensive computation. In Stefan's example above, somehow f is meant to know not just that it will be passed integer values, but furthermore that those values are meant to be expensive computations. It kind of requires that f ""know"" something about its surroundings. Depending on the program structure, this may not be easy.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A drawback of lazy evaluation is that, depending on how many computations you have delayed, you may end up at some point calling for all of them at once. This may or may not matter depending on the situation. </p>
</li>
<li><p>The main drawback of lazy evaluation is that it really does not play well in languages with side-effects (or I guess from my point of view this is a drawback of languages with side-effects, that they don't lend themselves well to lazy evaluation). If your ""expensiveValue"" produces a side-effect, then you do not know if that side-effect will occur, or even when it will occur in relation to other side-effects that may be taking place in the function f. Being uncertain about the order of execution of your program is not a good situation to be in.  </p>
</li>
</ol><p>Consider the following code example, which is not valid Scala but would illustrate the problems with having side-effects plus laziness:</p>
<pre><code>val y = 1;
def f(exp1: =&gt; Int) {
    lazy val x = exp1;
    y * x * y
}
def g() = { y = 3; 4 }
f(g())</code></pre>
<p>Here when the computation of exp1 is forced, the value of y would change (that's the side-effect, and Scala wouldn't allow that). But when does that happen in relation to the expression y<em>x</em>y? Would the first y and the third y end up with different values? Would they both have the value 1? Will they both have the value 3? It's best to avoid that kind of question.</p>

    anExpressionThatUsesTheAboveToComputeReturnStatement
}</code></pre>
<p>In other words there is always only one expression, which may be a big set of nested if-else blocks perhaps. The only reason for the multiple statements is so that you can declare some helper methods or intermediate values, but once you are done declaring those the rest should really be one expression, that computes the result value using the other declared quantities along the way.</p>
<p>It is imperative to stop thinking in an imperative way, saying something along the lines of ""do this; then do this; then do that"". Instead think declaratively: ""My answer is the result of this expression, in which this symbol means that value, and this inner function is defined this way, and .."". Do not read if-else as saying ""if this is true, then do that thing, else do the other thing"". Read it as saying ""My result is this expression if the logical test is true, otherwise it's this other expression"".</p>
<p>I'll add to that a specific comment for this problem. Instead of trying to raise an expression yourself, you can rely on xs.head to throw it for you.</p>

<p>Essentially, tail recursion optimisation transforms recursion into a loop, so you can evaluate the function in constant stack space. But with doubly recursive function, you need to go down at least one branch (it would still be possible to loop on the other branch).</p>
<p>It is sometimes possible to change the algorithm to avoid the double recursion entirely. For instance, Fibonacci numbers can be computed with a loop.

<p>Your screen capture shows that you are using JDK 8, but there is a problem.</p>
<p>Please use JDK 6 or 7 to proceed with this course. Because most recent version of sbt still has not supported JDK 8, you need to use JDK 6 or 7 for sbt.</p>
<p>Of course, you have to install JDK 6 or JDK 7. Please run those commands in your Terminal. </p>
<pre><code>$ /usr/libexec/java_home -v 1.6
/System/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/1.6.0.jdk/Contents/Home
**$ /usr/libexec/java_home -v 1.7**
/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.7.0_67.jdk/Contents/Home</code></pre>
<p>If you get results like above, it is just okay. If your result is like below, JDK 6 or JDK 7 is not installed.</p>
<pre><code>$ /usr/libexec/java_home -v 1.6
Unable to find any JVMs matching version ""1.6"".
/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_20.jdk/Contents/Home
$ /usr/libexec/java_home -v 1.7
Unable to find any JVMs matching version ""1.7"".
/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_20.jdk/Contents/Home</code></pre>
<p>Then you have to install JDK 6 or 7. I recommend JDK 7. Please visit <a href=""http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html"">this link</a> and get and install JDK 1.7 on your OS X.</p>
<p>BUT there are few steps to do something more. Please refer to <a href=""https://class.coursera.org/progfun-005/forum/thread?thread_id=174"">this link</a>. Brobbey had same problem on OS X. Posts in this thread are for sbt installed by Homebrew or manually by unpacking sbt*.tar.gz. If you installed sbt using MacPorts, you need to edit /opt/local/bin/sbt script, quite easy even though if you don't know bash script well.</p>

<p><b>I don't get what's going on with sets here. Isn't set just a data structure containing all of its elements?</b></p>
<p>There are different possible representations of sets. In this 
assignment, we represent sets by their indicator functions. An indicator
 function can only tell us one thing - whether something belongs to a 
given set or not. This is the reason why assignment defines <code>Set</code> as a type alias for functions from <code>Int</code> to <code>Boolean</code>.</p>
<p>This is an implicit representation, as opposed to explicit 
representation in form of a data structure containing all of the set's 
elements, and it comes with advantages and disadvantages. One 
disadvantage is that we cannot enumerate all elements of a given set, 
one advantage is that we can efficiently perform certain operations even
 with infinite sets.</p>
<p>Definition of what an indicator function is can be found in Wikipedia:</p>
<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indicator_function"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indicator_function</a></p>
<p><b>Infinite sets? What would an infinite set be?</b></p>
<pre><code>def evenNumbers: Set = x =&gt; x % 2 == 0</code></pre>
<p><b>I'm using <code>Set()</code> to construct a set and stuff starts blowing up in remote parts of my program. What am I doing wrong?</b></p>
<p><code>Set()</code> is from Scala's standard library, and it 
constructs a set in one of built-in explicit representations. If you 
want to create a set compatible with this assignment's definition, you 
should create a function. E.g.:</p>
<pre><code>def twoAndFive: Set = x =&gt; x == 2 || x == 5</code></pre>
<p>This creates a set that contains the integers two and five. Unfortunately, built-in <code>Set()</code>s define <code>apply</code>,
 so they can also look like functions, but for the purposes of this 
assignment you should use the representation described in the problem 
statement.</p>
<p><b>I'm done with <code>singletonSet()</code>, but how can there be a set with multiple elements given our definitions here?!</b></p>
<p>It would be a function that returns <code>true</code> in more than one case. See the example in the previous answer.</p>
<p><b>What would an empty set be?</b></p>
<pre><code>def emptySet: Set = x =&gt; false</code></pre>
<p><b>How do I detect an empty set?</b></p>
<p>You can't - as mentioned before, we cannot inspect the functions 
representing sets in this assignment. Good news is, we don't need that 
capability for any of the assignment problems. <code>exists</code> - to 
be implemented later in the assignment - kinda allows you to check 
whether the set is empty... within given bounds. So that's not a real 
test for an empty set.</p>
<p><b>What are these <code>union</code>, <code>intersect</code> and <code>set difference</code> things?</b></p>
<p>This is from basic set theory. Don't worry, this is no rocket 
science, you can learn all the set theory you need for this assignment 
in quarter an hour. See, for example:</p>
<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_set_operations#Basic_operations"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_set_operations#Basic_operations</a></p>
<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebra_of_sets"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebra_of_sets</a></p>
<p>Not that we're using <i>set-theoretic difference</i> as difference in this assignment, rather than <i>symmetric set difference</i>.</p>
<p><b>Can I assume the same bounds as described in <code>forall</code> and <code>exists</code> tasks apply to <code>union</code> etc.?</b></p>
<p>No. They do apply for <code>map</code> (in a way), but the rest of 
your solutions should be general. Norman Graham, one of the CTAs for 
Spring '13 class, put it this way:</p>
<p>""Bounds are not needed for the implementation of <code>union()</code>.
 If you're thinking in terms of iterating over a range of integers, then
 you're probably falling back into imperative thought patterns. Pay 
attention to the type signatures and think about how you can define <code>union()</code> directly as a Set in terms of <code>s</code> and <code>t</code>.""</p>
<p><b>The grader complains about my implementation of <code>diff</code> for some strange reason.</b></p>
<p>Make sure your difference is not symmetric. See above for links explaining the difference between the two.</p>
<p><b>Is there any difference between <code>intersect</code> and <code>filter</code>?</b></p>
<p>Not really.</p>
<p><b>What should <code>forall</code> evaluate to when given an empty set?</b></p>
<p>True. This follows from the duality of existential and universal 
classifiers (extended de Morgan's laws). The reasoning is the same as 
with ""sum of an empty sequence"" or ""product of an empty sequence"" - the 
result should be the identity element of the operation, which is ""true"" 
for conjunction.</p>
<p><b>Should <code>forall</code> and <code>exists</code> terminate as soon as the result is known for certain?</b></p>
<p>Definitely.</p>
<p><b>Both of them?!</b></p>
<p>Yeah. Remember, <code>forall</code> is just an <code>exists</code> in disguise. And vice versa.</p>
<p><b>Must I define <code>exists</code> in terms of <code>forall</code>?</b></p>
<p>Why wouldn't you? Remember, <code>forall</code> is just an <code>exists</code> in disguise. And vice versa.</p>
<p><b>I'm looking at <code>map</code> and I don't even know how to approach this problem.</b></p>
<p>A couple of crucial hints: you can't find the inverse of an arbitrary
 function. For the mathematically inclined there's a proof here:</p>
<p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13404208/in-pure-functional-languages-is-there-an-algorithm-to-get-the-inverse-function/13405526#13405526"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13404208/in-pure-functional-languages-is-there-an-algorithm-to-get-the-inverse-function/13405526#13405526</a></p>
<p>This result should be quite intuitive, especially since we're 
treating the function here as a black box - we can't know anything about
 it, we can only ask it abouts its outputs for different inputs.</p>
<p>Secondly, our implementation of <code>exists</code> is somewhat lacking, but if we implement <code>map</code> as if our <code>exists</code> worked perfectly in all cases that will be enough for the grader.</p>
<p><b>What's a partial application? What's currying? What is the difference between them? How are they related?</b></p>
<p>There's always a lot of confusion between currying and partial applications.</p>
<p>Partial application is easy. Fundamentally, we just take some function <code>(a, b, c ...) =&gt; z</code> and produce a new function with reduced domain by simply fixing some of the arguments. E.g., consider <span>+:<span>Z2</span>→Z</span> We can make a successor function <span>succ:Z→Z</span> out of it by fixing one of the summands to be one:</p>
<pre><code>def succ(x: Int) = x + 1</code></pre>
<p>This is a partial application of the <code>+</code> operator (and Scala being a language with rich syntax, you can express this in a lot of different ways, including <code>(_ + 1)</code>).</p>
<p>Currying, on the other hand, is simply an operation that transforms ""uncurried"" function with type <code>(a, b) =&gt; c</code> into its ""curried"" equivalent <code>a =&gt; b =&gt; c</code>, and uncurrying is the dual operation.</p>
<pre><code>def curry2[A, B, C](f: (A, B) =&gt; C)(x: A)(y: B) = f(x, y)
def uncurry2[A, B, C](f: A =&gt; B =&gt; C)(x: A, y: B) = f(x)(y)</code></pre>
<p>There are two things currying has in common with partial application.</p>
<p>Firstly, currying is implemented in terms of partial application (if you desugar the <code>curry2</code> definition above, for example):</p>
<pre><code>def curry2[A, B, C](f: (A, B) =&gt; C) = (x: A) =&gt; (y: B) =&gt; f(x, y)</code></pre>
<p>Secondly, curried functions make it easy to create their partially applied versions.</p><p><br /></p>

You completely finish each part and free up the memory before starting the next (like tail recursion optimisation would do for you). <br />The idea behind a trampoline is that you don't know beforehand what the next part will be. It's decided within your previous part. To achieve this you start passing around ""jumps"" to other functions (or function parts). Or return an entire function part so it can be called next.<br /><br />For example, let's write an algorithm for Fibonacci. The main function exists of a list of functions that we still have to call and an iteration over this list until it is empty. Initially the list contains only fib(n). The function fib(n) will return 2 new functions which are added to our list. Namely ""fib(n-1)"" and ""fib(n-2)"". When this function has returned all reserved memory can be freed (by garbage collection, you yourself, ...). <br />The function will then process fib(n-1), again returning 2 new functions to call later and freeing up the used memory. We can also optimise our main function to recognise that we have 2 times fib(n-2) in our list so we only need to call it once. This means that we will always have at most 3 functions in memory, ready to be called later, always freeing up memory from previous function calls.<br />If we reach fib(2) or fib(1), they will no longer return new functions but the value 1. Our main function only has to add up all those values to find the final result.<br /><br />Hope this helps :)",NA,NA,NA

So as long as I do something with my set, its complexity grows.<br /><br />If I use map() for this set, it's complexity will grow even more. I don't even mention, what will happen, if I use map several times.<br /><br />Isn't it bad? Can one do something with it?<br /><br /><strong>UPD:</strong> I should mention, that the biggest problem here for me is the map() function. If one implements it using exists(), map() has terrible performance, because in the worst case one needs to check $$2 \times bound$$ values (i.e. $$2000$$) of the original set to understand whether some value is inside a set, created by map().",NA,NA,NA

I'd never really known what I wanted to do in life until I was forced to learn how to write vba scripts (very modest beginning) whilst work for an engineering company during my placement year (3rd year of my mechanical engineering degree). I was working on a project that required gathering data from various obsolete data bases and trying to extract meaningful data to estimate meantime to failure of components and hence single out those that needed re-engineering. Needless to say it was a very tedious task and the code I wrote although it worked for a given data set was pretty much impossible to reuse! The most fun came when because of the sheer amount of data excel would just crash when running one of the scripts, however it worked when I just ran through the code line by line (I remember having propped a pencil on the right key to run it overnight). Fun times!!!!<br /><br />I don't think anything is comparable to writing your own programs and actually seeing them do something for you (not always what you wanted them to do). I can't think of any other field where you can see the instantaneous results of your hardwork and that's what I love so much about coding and what pushed me to start from the basics: assembly x86 &amp; c<br /><br />If anyone else cares to share I'd love to read you.<br /><br />Happy coding.<br /><br />LinkedIn: <a href=""http://uk.linkedin.com/in/benjaminrcbell/"">uk.linkedin.com/in/benjaminrcbell/</a><br />",NA,NA,NA

Alas, there were so many lectures and labs each week, that it didn't fit my high school schedule. What to do, what to do. There was on Introduction to Computer Programming with Basic that fit the schedule and slightly interested me. So I took that.

It is described in the instructions, in the ""Representation"" (emphasis is mine) :<br /><br /><em>Therefore, </em><strong><em>we choose to represent a set by its characterisitc function </em></strong><em>and define a type alias for this representation</em><br /><br />Remember here that we are talking about mathematical sets, not the usual programming sets. The above quote says it all, it's a function. In particular, our sets here can be infinite in size (the set of all Ints &gt; 42, for example), and therefore cannot fit into the (finite) memory of any computer. However, a simple charasteristic function can.<br /><br />So you don't have an actual ""box that contains this Int and that Int, and ...."". You only have someone who can tell you, when you ask him, whether <b>any given Int </b>is in the box or not. But has no way of telling you <b>all </b>the Ints that are in that box ! <br /><br />So the set is not a programming set, which is usually an unordered, finite number of distinct elements, here it is a function.<br /><br />Moreover, as to why s(1) evaluates to true :<br /><br /><pre><code>def contains(s: Set, elem: Int): Boolean = s(elem)</code></pre>If you accept this definition, it means that s(1) = contains(s, 1) ...<br /><br /><br />Hope my explanations are clear enough and helpful.<br /><br />Cheers !<br />Daniel<br /><br /><br />",NA,NA,NA

I have no trouble understanding it from mathematical point of view. It is perfectly clear for me that our set it is simple function that tells me if integer is in a box or not. Explanation of why s(1)=cointains(s,1) is also clear (from mathematical point of view -&gt; expression on right &amp; letf side of equals sign means the same) but not from the code. Your answer does not satisfy my needs.<br /><br />I think that it'll be best ot show that. Let me define simple app which prints set contents:<br /><br /><pre><code>package funsets
import funsets.FunSets._

object Main extends App {

  /** creates set of ranged integers */
  def createTestSet(min: Int, max: Int): Set = {
    def loop(i: Int, set: Set): Set =
      if (i &gt;= max) set
      else loop(i + 1, union(set, singletonSet(i)))

    if (max &lt;= min) throw new IllegalArgumentException(""max value must be greater than min value"")
    else loop(min, singletonSet(min))
  }


  val s = createTestSet(1, 11)
  println(printSet(s))
}</code></pre><br />If you run this program, it'll print you values form 1 to 10. What I am interested in, is how this looks in memory and how s(5) or s(-2) is evaluated. When you put a break point in line with println statement and look into debugger you'll probably see somethng like this:<br /><br /><img src=""https://coursera-forum-screenshots.s3.amazonaws.com/5c/e84fc045c511e48f1845efdeb9afa3/set_mem_repr.jpg"" style=""width:288px;height:248px;"" alt=""set_mem_repr.jpg"" /><br /><br />It looks like some kind of recursive data structure which holds this ""characteristic function"" of our set. Is it because because when we create our set using union &amp; singletonSet function function, we end up simething like this?<br /><pre><code>singletonSet(1) is actually expression which becomes -&gt; x == 1
union(singletonSet(1), singletonSet(2)) is actually expression which becomes -&gt; x == 1 || x ==2
finally variable 's' becomes expression which becomes -&gt; x == 1 || x == 2 || x == 3 || ... || x == 10 
s(5) becomes -&gt; 5 == 1 || 5 == 2 || ... || 5 == 5 || ... || 5 == 10 -&gt; which evaluates to true
s(-1) becomes -&gt; -1 == 1 || -1 == 2 || ... || -1 == 10 -&gt; which evaluates to false</code></pre>If that's the case, than how filter function return multiple values instead of one?<br /><br />From what I understand, when we apply my way of thinking than filter should look like eg:<br /><br /><pre><code>def filter(s: Set, p: Int =&gt; Boolean): Set = /* actual implementation hidden to not reveal it */

//assume s = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}
filter(s, x =&gt; x % 2 == 0) //returns {2,4,6,8,10}

so actually call to filter results in following expression:
(x == 1 || x == 2 || x == 3 || ... || x == 10) &amp;&amp; (x % 2 == 0)
</code></pre>Yes, from mathematical point of view, this expression have multiple solutions. But how is it evaluated by computer? <br />To return multiple elements you need to call this expression multiple times for different x values. This needs loop or some recursion.<br />So how is this possible that it returns multiple values instead of one in one call? Is there some recursive/loop call which I don't see? <br />",NA,NA,NA

I was using map/filter results in printSet function.<br /><br />Nevertheless, it looks like those set really unravel to those long or/and expressions.

When we call f(3) it actually check or-like expressions to test if number belongs to set and than applies filter function.<br /><br /><br />PS:<br />@Daniel: What is a better way to define ranged set using methods from current assignment?

<pre><code>def checkInts(f: (Int,Int) =&gt; Boolean) = {
  // do stuff
}</code></pre>
<p>Can also be written as  </p>
<pre><code>trait Foo {
  type MyFunction = (Int,Int) =&gt; Boolean

  def checkInts(f: MyFunction)
  def checkInts(f: Option[MyFunction])
}</code></pre>
<p>MyFunction type returns an anonymous function that is passed to the checkInts function. If you are familiar with other programming languages think of it as a method signature saying that an Int goes in one end Boolean comes out on the other end. What happens in the middle is what we do to pass our test.  </p>
<p>In fact let's take that a step further - doing this helps me understand the assignment  </p>
<pre><code>object FunSets {
  /**
   * We represent a set by its characteristic function, i.e.
   * its `contains` predicate.
   */
  // type Set = Int =&gt; Boolean 
  // let's just rename set to TryParse. That is all we are doing
  type TryParse = Int =&gt; Boolean
  // In C# this is what the method would look like
  // public static bool   TryParse(int x) 
}</code></pre>
<p>We are simply repeating this over and over again - first in simple functions (contains), then composing them together (union/diff), then using the same concept in a code block e.g. in the forall exercise.  </p>
<p>I think that ominously Martin Ordesky ended one of his videos on lambda substitutions by saying that we should keep it in mind because it will be useful in the following weeks. I don't think that this assignment is about Types but implementing substitutions. That may seem obvious to those with more Scala experience, so obvious that it doesn't need repeating, but it really is frustrating not knowing what knowledge to bring to bear on a particular assignment. Perhaps it was covered again in the lecture on<a href=""https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/progfun/lecture_slides/week3-3.pdf"">Evaluation and Operations</a> but the maths syntax got in the way for me.</p>

Think of Map as ""ReMap"" or ""change to something else"" or ""Convert the source data"" and then think of Reduce as ""Combine the remapped stuff to give a final result"".<br /><br />For example, if you were reading a book you might scan through each word in the first book and remap each word found to a new object which is (String,Int) - The word and the number 1. <br /><br />Now you have a list of words and a number 1 against each. Time to reduce the amount of data by combining it. So what you'd do is to go through the list of (String, Int) and combine it so that it is a new list of (String, Int) where each word is unique and the integer is the total number of times it was encountered.  <br /><br />Why do it this way? Well now you can take the reduced results (word + wordcount) from multiple servers which were all counting words in different books and reduce them again to give a total occurrences of each word in the complete works of Shakespeare.<br /><br />Map Reduce therefore means<br />1) Map = Convert the source into a new object format you want to work with<br />2) Reduce = Now operate on all of those remapped objects that are easier to work on to give your final result.<br /><br />Another example is the SQL statement Sum(OrderTotal) group by Client;  The Map part would take a row in a SQL table and output a ClientID, OrderTotal. The Reduce part would group them together by combining into a unique collection of Clients with the added OrderTotals of each individual client.<br /><br />I hope that made some sense.",NA,NA,NA

It's probably similar to functional programming in that it defaults to immutable data and list and tree processing would be similar in any language that defaulted to immutable structure.  I  have learned some functional programming trying to learn Clojure.  <br /><br />We probably won't deal too much longer with recursion. Generally we will process data using predefined higher level functions. There we will consider the input types of a function compared to the output type of the function,  then the function is designed by applying higher level functions that transform the input types to the output types usually with lambda functions passed as parameters doing the specific custom transformations. Many programs are just a pipe line of type transformations from input to out put.  Much different way of thinking is involved compared to imperative programming which uses imperative looping.<br /><br />Clojure is a little different since it is dynamically typed language.  There rather than transforming type to type, you transform ""shape"" of data to ""shape"" of data but much of the principles are the same.

Why is it a recommendation to downgrade my computer and install outdated software? I can't do that because I need actual versions of Scala and Java for my daily business! So I really tried everything I found in these forums and in the net to get the assignment code working with up-to-date software but I failed.<br /><br />In my opinion this course is not for students who want to learn functional programming with Scala.

It seems there is a problem importing sbt projects with java 8. For windows, the solution is to set the path for JAVA_HOME to point to jdk 7 in the sbt.bat file in ../sbt/bin. This won't affect the rest of the system.<br />I work with ubuntu (linux) and it is also possible to switch from one java version to another before working on assignments.<br /><br />Furthermore, there is no need to install older version of scala since the scala version is specified in the sbt file in each project (build.sbt file, 3 line). sbt will automatically download and use the specified scala version. <br /><br />Finally, I personally think that the most important thing in this course are the informations provided in lectures. The concepts presented are not outdated and are really useful to get an insight on functional programming, specially for someone used to imperative programming. <br /><br />Regards, <br /><br />",NA,NA,NA

<p>there's something that's not clear to me in lectures <code>3.1</code> and <code>3.2</code>, and pardon me if it's answered in the <code>3.3</code> lecture I have yet to see. </p>
<p>It is said in <code>3.1</code> that, as in Java, classes only gets one supertype, and can be extended with traits, that are better than interfaces. Then in <code>3.2</code>, it is said that class <code>scala.Nothing</code> is subclass of all the other types, and class <code>scala.Null</code> is subclass of all the <code>scala.AnyRef</code>.</p>
<p>How is that possible?</p>
<ul><li>is <code>scala.Nothing</code> actually subclass of <code>scala.Any</code>?</li>
<li>and is <code>scala.Null</code> a subclass of <code>scala.AnyRef</code>?</li>
</ul><p>But then, in the global class hierarchy tree of lecture <code>3.2</code>, why not representing both at subclasses of, respectively, <code>scala.Any</code> and <code>scala.AnyRef</code> instead of saying they're subclasses of every type and every <code>AnyRef</code> subtype?</p>
<p>or is there some magic, rebuilding both types so they getting extended by each and every new type? Or am I totally missing something here?</p>
<p>All in all, it's confusing me a bit, and I'd like to get some explanation of the logics in play here, before digging in the <code>Nothing</code> and <code>Null</code> source codes…</p>

Then you have the temptation to do type matching, isInstanceOf, isEmpty and other bad techniques that would be against the spirit of a good solution - albeit might pass the grader.

It would seem that we'd be more likely to get a clean solution through implementing descendingByRetweet directly - with the hint to have methods on the TweetList to maintain it as a sorted list. And it would be at least as efficient.

In other words, if the actual memory image looks anything like the conceptual one, as introduced in the lecture, then it follows that Scala's handling of memory is suboptimal compared to an OOP language that can mutate it's data structures. My intuition is that the Scala compiler is well aware of this nuance and compiles the Scala code to efficient byte code. Thoughts?<br /><br />Dan",NA,NA,NA

<p>This way there is a very clear separation between a list that has no elements, and one that has at least one element. From an object-oriented point of view, almost all methods you would write would need to behave differently for the two kinds of lists.

<p>Perhaps neither of those arguments would convince you, but at least they're food for thought.</p>

To a seasoned functional programmer is probably a clear and intuitive solution. Certainly unravelling tricks like this is a good way to develop a deeper understanding.

To write in functional style, you need to think the way mathematicians do. Why? Because this is what Scala and other functional languages allow you to express easily while writing a program. Then, the question is how do mathematicians think, right?<br /><br />Do you solve most of the tasks top-to-bottom using the divide'n'conquer approach?

<p>Once we have this definition we don't need anything else in mind at all, no state: we don't need to picture the state of our program in our head (and we should not try as mentally imagining recursion is quite difficult).</p>
<p>In fact we need to think like recursion does: we start as if it was the first time every time and we don't need to store things in our head for later use, there is just now because if our definition is accurate, it was also true in the past and it will stay true in the future.</p>
<p>There is a nice example of this kind of way of thinking in the second week assignment on the implementation of the map() function which is just the literal translation in Scala of the definition of the problem of returning a new set of numbers transformed by a function <code>f</code> <code>""X is part of map(Set, f) if there exist an Int in Set such as f(Int) = X""</code></p>
<p>So I think that the important thing is to build little ""truths"" we can then use as bricks knowing that truths are immutable we can rely on them without a second thought. It's similar to OO programming where we have objects which we know do there job and we don't need to have any knowledge of their entrails or state to use them...</p>
<p>It's just about freeing our mind^^</p>
<p>This is what I think now but this is still a work in progress...</p>

In a way, SQL queries are functional programming kind of programs ('select' clause is actually map, aggregate functions are reduce functions, 'where' clause is filter, etc.).<br /><br />To me, this resonates with the mathematical roots of functional programming. Immutability and referential transparency are basically language features that help us to adopt this way of thinking, because they prevent us from thinking about memory locations, references and program counters (as in imperative style).<br /><br />So in short - think ""declarative"", it usually works for me :-)",NA,NA,NA

<p>I, for one, could only submit the first homework a couple of days after the first deadline, and I'm a bit hesitant about joining the signature track starting with a penalization on the simplest homework.</p>
<p>So I was wondering if youthere is a chance you extend the first homeworks' deadlines to let latecomers join signature track.</p>

As a rule of thumb, you would put methods in an abstract class you absolutely want all children classes to have, but you cannot necessarily be specific enough in it's implementation in the abstract class. For instance - suppose you have an abstract class $$Animal$$ which has the method $$communicate$$ and extends to the classes $$Human$$, $$Dog$$, and $$Cat$$. The latter classes are then required to implement their respective methods of $$communicate$$. That's to say, all $$Animal$$s communicate differently (uniquely).",NA,NA,NA

But having said this I will quote this sentence from the assignments page <a title=""Link: https://class.coursera.org/progfun-005/assignment"" href=""https://class.coursera.org/progfun-005/assignment"">https://class.coursera.org/progfun-005/assignment</a>  which you can find under each assignment's submission score table:<br /><br />""Assignments are authenticated overall if at least half of the submitted,
 non-optional assignment parts are authenticated. The authentication 
status for each part is the authentication status of the attempt counted
 as the effective score.""<br /><br />This actually may explain why you didn't receive authenticated status for the first assignment. The reason may be that your unauthenticated score is higher than that of the authenticated score because the authenticated score has a penalty due to being submitted after the due date. If this is the case it will pick the higher score as the final score and it's authentication status. <br /><br />You should also remember to regenerate your submission passwords before submitting. They expire pretty quickly as well so it is best to generate them right before submitting.<br /><br />In any case, as long as you submit at least half of the assignments with proper authentication you should be ok, as you can see from the quote above.

And this is the part I don't really undestand in Scala (Java?) behavour?<br /><br />If I append <code>val</code>  to ""elem"" in the NonEmpty's constructor OR define a separate accessor (field / parameter - you name it), then I only have access to it, unless I call another method in between (i.e chaining is NOT working).<br /><br />For example:<br /><br /><pre><code>val test = new NonEmpty(new Tweet(""A"", ""A"", 1), new Empty, new Empty)

test.elem # =&gt; Works.
test.filter(tw =&gt; 1 == 1).elem # Doesn't work</code></pre>In order to make the latter example work I had to define a method inside of the TweetSet abstact class and then implement it inside both ""Empty"" and ""NonEmpty"" classes.<br /><br />But why is that?

If a () =&gt; Int function is being passed to something that also expects a function, then the function itself is passed - if it's being passed to something that expects an Int, then the function is called, and the value is passed.<br /><br />So I suggest that the 2 functions being compared in the original question are exactly the same - one of them has just omitted the (presumably, optional) () when writing a function type that takes no parameters. ...and so called ""pass-by-name"" parameters are really just passing around functions.<br /><br />What do you guys think?<br /><br />-Jonathan<br />",NA,NA,NA

<p>I've submitted my solution for Week 3 assignment, and it fails with a message listed below. I'm failing to understand what exactly is wrong with my results. It refers to test case about trending google and apple tweets, but I'm mostly sure it runs okay, at least on my machine running the program produces meaningful and well sorted results.</p>
<p>Now there's a catch: it's already my 3rd submission, and my first 2 were wrong. Now I'm sure I've corrected the mistakes. Could it be that the grading system didn't update my code properly, and built the older version? Or maybe not grading system, but my IDE or SBT or whoever. Anyone faced this?</p>

<br /><br />The reason why I'm asking is because when I first clicked a ""Generate password"" button under an assignment I got a popup window with a 2-step procedure to verify my identity (typing, face). But I decided to close this window (because I cannot verify myself right now) and then I saw a non-verified password, which got expired in couple of hours (approx; I don't know the exact duration).
<br /><br />And another question I have - can I do multiple submissions for the same assignment with a single verified password or I need to verify the identity every time I want to submit?

In this context both forms will work fine but they are a little different ""under the hood"". <br /><br />When you use def you are creating a method which belongs to the object or class containing that definition. That method could also be called from outside the object or class (unless you declare the method as private). The method has a name (emptySet).<br /><br />When you use val here you are creating an anonymous function (aka function literal) and assigning that to the val emptySet.  Here ""emptySet"" is not the name of the function. You could for instance do this...<br /><pre><code>val emptySet = (Int) =&gt; false
val anonFunCopy = emptySet</code></pre>Now both values point to the same function literal and you can use either to evaluate the function.<br /><br />The Scala compiler is very flexible, so if you have a function that expects a function literal as a parameter it will also work with an equivalent class or object method, as you've found.<br /><br />",NA,NA,NA

val foo = {
  val N = 10

It should be seen as a generalized switch-expression rather than checking the types (actually, it comes from pattern matching in functional languages such as ML and Haskell).<br /><br />Secondly, the OO way can be better in some cases, namely when new subclasses of your abstract class may be added in the future.

But I think this example was designed so we get used to pattern matching. CodeTree is just markup, no behavior specified there and it is used in all method signatures. So it does not represent anything alone. In order to used it,  you MUST do some pattern matching or casting. Implementation classes could be private, for usege of Huffman; the CodeTree itself could not be visible to user if interface would be just <code>encode/decode</code> methods from Chars to Bits and vice versa. </p>
<p>If I would be developing this example from scratch I would add some behaviour/property to CodeTree, to get rid of weight and chars methods and keep CodeTree as class with private visibility  But again for learning the pattern matching it is great.</p>

<p>The lecture shows how to do something like:  </p>
<pre><code>List(1,2,3,4,5,6) match {
   case 1 :: 2 :: _ =&gt; ""success!""
   case default =&gt; ""failure :'(""
 }</code></pre>
<p>The above works great. In the above matcher, _ can be a list of any size.  </p>
<p>So I try to do:  </p>
<pre><code>List(1,2,3,4,5,6) match {
   case _ :: 5 :: _ =&gt; ""success!""
   case default =&gt; ""failure :'(""
 }  </code></pre>
<p>This does not work, because :: can only be used to prepend a single element to a list, not an entire list. The above results in failure.  </p>
<p>So the natural thing to do would be:  </p>
<pre><code>List(1,2,3,4,5,6) match {
  case  _ ::: 5 :: _ =&gt; ""success!""
  case default =&gt; ""failure :'(""
} </code></pre>
<p>Instead of matching a single element prepending to a list beginning with 5, I can prepend a list to a list beginning with 5.<br /></p>
<p>However, this results in the following error:  </p>
<pre><code>Cannot resolve symbol :::</code></pre>
<p>So what gives? Is it impossible to use the ::: operator in pattern matching because it could lead to ambiguous matching? Ie, in the above example, if there were multiple 5's in the list, it seems like it would be ambiguous which 5 was chosen.  </p>
<p>Anyway, I know the alternative is to use recursion (well, depending on the use case...), I'd just be curious to learn more about this, and google doesn't really like "":::""</p>",NA,NA,NA

It is authored by Pavel Lepin<br /><br /><p><b>Why is <code>Empty</code> a <code>class</code> rather than an <code>object</code>?</b></p>
<p>Looks like a simple oversight. Yes, a singleton would likely make more sense here.</p>
<p><b>Can I extend the interface of provided classes?</b></p>
<p>Yes. As long as your implementation conforms to the behavior 
specified by the assignment, you may extend class definitions with 
additional methods. Note that you probably shouldn't tinker with classes
 outside of <code>TweetSet.scala</code>.</p>
<p><b>I'd like to use <code>foreach</code> in my solution. May I?</b></p>
<p>Not really. <code>foreach</code> doesn't evaluate to anything useful,
 so the only way to use it would be resorting to side effects, which is 
something we're trying to keep away from in this class.</p>
<p><b>I don't get <code>filterAcc</code>. What's it for?</b></p>
<p>It's a helper function for <code>filter</code>. It builds the result using <code>acc</code> as an intermediate result.</p>
<p><b>Should <code>filterAcc</code> be tail-recursive? Accumulator variable seems to hint at it.</b></p>
<p>No. There's no point in making <code>filterAcc</code> tail-recursive as it won't result in any substantial performance gain.</p>
<p><b>How exactly am I supposed to collect the values for <code>filterAcc</code>? I can recurse on just one branch.</b></p>
<p>Actually, you can recurse on both. Think about Pascal's triangle. 
There's an additional complication in this case, as one of your 
recursive calls should be using the result of the other.</p>
<p><b>Okay, but I don't know how to add values to <code>acc</code>. It's immutable.</b></p>
<p>You can't and you don't need to. Create a new set and use it as accumulator afterwards.</p>
<p><b>I seem to need <code>union</code> for <code>filter</code>. Am I right?</b></p>
<p>Not really, it can be done without <code>union</code>, and the solution is pretty simple.</p>
<p><b>How do I detect an empty set? There doesn't appear to be any way to do it.</b></p>
<p>An OO approach would be to provide different implementations of some methods for <code>Empty</code> and <code>NonEmpty</code>. A particular case of this would be to create an <code>isEmpty</code> method that returns different values for <code>Empty</code> and <code>NonEmpty</code>, though this is not necessarily the best approach, depending on one's style preferences. You definitely shouldn't be using <code>isInstanceOf</code> or using <code>null</code>, however. We will learn yet another way to tackle this problem in later weeks.</p>
<p><b>Catching a thrown exception seems to be a sound way to deal with the problem of handling empty sets.</b></p>
<p>You shouldn't do that. Exception handling seems to come with 
substantial overhead on JVM, and in previous run of the class some 
students ran into grader timeouts due to taking this approach.</p>
<p><b>Just how fast should union be? Can I use the implementation given in the lectures?</b></p>
<p>Pretty fast. At the very least you should be able to <code>run</code>
 the program and see the results in a second or so (this may vary 
depending upon hardware and JVM settings, with some students reporting 
execution time for <code>run</code> of up to ten seconds when running 
perfectly fine solutions in resource-constrained environment). The 
implementation in the lectures does not fit this criterion.</p>
<p>Note that there are several simple implementations that achieve 
linearithmic asymptotic complexity on average, which should be 
sufficient for your solution to be accepted. If you want an extra 
challenge, try finding and implementing a linear solution. It's a good 
deal more involved than simpler approaches, but it's a beautiful 
algorithm, and it balances the resulting tree as an added bonus. Hint: 
this is somewhat similar to mergesort. The tricky part is reconstructing
 the tree from a linear representation of the resulting set in linear 
time. This may require some degree of recursive ingenuity.</p>
<p><b>So how do I implement <code>union</code> efficiently?</b></p>
<p>Various approaches may succeed, including an implementation very 
similar to the one in the lectures that exhibits much better peformance.
 Some students used a variety of alternate approaches, including some 
making use of <code>filter</code>.</p>
<p><b>Shouldn't <code>mostRetweeted</code> be <code>leastRetweeted</code> instead?</b></p>
<p>No. <code>mostRetweeted</code> should return the tweet with the highest number of retweets in a set. It is perfectly possible to implement <code>descendingByRetweet</code> using <code>mostRetweeted</code> rather than <code>leastRetweeted</code>.</p>
<p><b>How do I break the ties for <code>mostRetweeted</code>?</b></p>
<p>Ties may be broken abritrarily in this case. When two or more tweets 
have the same number of retweets, it doesn't matter which one of them 
you return as <code>mostRetweeted</code>.</p>
<p><b>My <code>descendingByRetweet</code> is in reverse order. How do I reverse it?</b></p>
<p>You can simply ""reverse"" the way you're constructing it. It's not 
quite as straightforward as exchanging two expressions, but it's not 
much more challenging than that.</p>
<p><b>Running the program / accessing <code>allTweets</code> seems to take forever.</b></p>
<p>See the question about <code>union</code> performance. <code>union</code> affects quite a lot of other stuff, including provided code.</p>",NA,NA,NA

It is authored by Pavel Lepin</p><p><b>May I use <code>List</code> methods from the standard library in this assignment?</b></p>
<p>You could give it a shot, but you would be at grader's mercy. None of the <code>List</code> methods are needed for this assignment (including <code>sortBy</code> / <code>sortWith</code>
 - Prof. Odersky demonstrated a simple implementation in the lectures, 
though a very practical mergesort implementation wouldn't be hard to put
 together either), and solutions based on pattern matching will be 
pretty concise.</p>
<p><b>Should I make my solutions tail-recursive?</b></p>
<p><code>until</code> and <code>codeBits</code> are two functions where 
it would make sense (because it's a very natural way to express those 
two functions). Other than that, no.</p>
<p><b>Is empty list a singleton?</b></p>
<p>No.</p>
<p><b>Should <code>combine</code> process the list recursively until only a singleton is left?</b></p>
<p>No. <code>combine</code> performs one iteration of that process, decreasing the list size by one on the outside. The rest is the job for <code>createCodeTree</code>.</p>
<p><b>Should <code>combine</code> try to repair invalid inputs, such as duplicate characters in the trees to be combined?</b></p>
<p>No. You may assume valid input.</p>
<p><b>May I throw an exception if <code>combine</code> is passed a <code>Nil</code>?</b></p>
<p>No. Assignment instructions are unambiguous here.</p>
<p><b><code>until</code> looks like an imperative loop. How do I implement something like that in a functional fashion?</b></p>
<p>Iteration is equivalent to tail-recursion. You might want to take a look at FAQ for assignment 1.</p>
<p><b>Do I really need to use <code>mergeCodeTables</code> in my implementation of <code>convert</code>?</b></p>
<p>Not really. The grader won't explicitly check for dependencies here. Using a certain approach to implementing <code>mergeCodeTables</code> will lead to a particularly elegant and succint version of <code>convert</code>, but that's not to say there cannot be elegant and succint implementations of <code>convert</code> that take a different approach.</p>
<p><b>When I'm traversing the code tree using a helper function, I 
have to pass an extra argument that is completely useless until I need 
it for a recursive call at the very end of the traversal. That kinda 
looks ugly.</b></p>
<p>Note that you helper function closes on everything in the outer function's scope... including its arguments.</p>
<p><b>Grader says my encoding is not minimal.</b></p>
<p><code>combine</code> relies on a certain list invariant (described in
 the handout) for picking a pair of trees with the lowest weight. It's 
rather easy to overlook that <code>combine</code> also needs to <i>maintain</i> said invariant. If you fail to do so, your encoding will be sub-optimal.</p>
<p><b>Grader says my encoding is impossibly efficient.</b></p>
<p>There are great many ways to get this wrong. You should start looking for bugs by checking that the composition of your <code>encode</code> and <code>decode</code> is an identity (that is, you get your plaintext back by encoding then decoding).</p>
<p><b>Why would <code>someText</code> need 1919 bits to encode?!</b></p>
<p>That's just the name of the variable containing the plaintext to be encoded on the grader side.</p>
<p><b>What does it mean for an encoding to be optimal?</b></p>
<p>The short answer is, you don't need to worry about this, if you precisely follow the assignment instructions your encoding <i>will</i> be optimal.</p>
<p>A longer answer is, proper Huffman encoding is optimal in the 
following sense: if we assume that our sample string is representative 
of the true underlying distribution of character frequencies, and that 
individual characters/symbols are independent and identically 
distributed, then Huffman code for sufficiently long strings drawn from 
said distribution will minimize the expected length of codetext among 
all possible lossless encodings for said distribution. If you're 
interested in this topic, Wikipedia would be a decent start for further 
reading:</p>
<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding</a></p>
<p><b>There are many possible optimal trees. Which one should I pick?</b></p>
<p>The provided test for <code>combine</code> is an implicit 
specification of how exactly you should construct your tree. The same 
test will be run on the server, so make sure your implementation passes 
it.</p>
<p><b>What should I do if the sample text only has one unique character / no characters at all in it?</b></p>
<p>Feel free to blow up the grader's fridge. Huffman code is not particularly well-defined for these cases.</p>
<p><b><code>CodeTable</code> is a very inefficient representation with awful lookups. Should I redefine it?</b></p>
<p>No. This is really just for demonstration purposes, so you should leave it be, despite its inefficiency.</p>",NA,NA,NA

00:00:53,591</div><div>In the last session, we have looked in</div><div>depth at a lot of different aspects of a</div><div><br /></div><div>2</div><div>00:00:53,591 --&gt; 00:00:57,581</div><div>single class.</div><div>What we're going to do in this session is</div><div><br /></div><div>3</div><div>00:00:57,581 --&gt; 00:01:03,000</div><div>generalize that so that we now look at</div><div>class hierarchies, where more than one</div><div><br /></div><div>4</div><div>00:01:03,000 --&gt; 00:01:05,780</div><div>class cooperates to achieve a certain</div><div>task.</div><div><br /></div><div>5</div><div>00:01:06,000 --&gt; 00:01:12,051</div><div>So, as a running example in this session,</div><div>we consider the task of writing a set of</div><div><br /></div><div>6</div><div>00:01:12,051 --&gt; 00:01:18,078</div><div>classes, that implement sets of integers.</div><div>And these integers set will be called</div><div><br /></div><div>7</div><div>00:01:18,078 --&gt; 00:01:24,064</div><div>inset and support two operations.</div><div>Include, to include an element x in the</div><div><br /></div><div>8</div><div>00:01:24,064 --&gt; 00:01:30,482</div><div>inset and contain, which is a test whether</div><div>an element x is a member of the set.</div><div><br /></div><div>9</div><div>00:01:30,482 --&gt; 00:01:35,477</div><div>So, to do that, I would open a fresh</div><div>worksheet.</div><div><br /></div><div>10</div><div>00:01:35,477 --&gt; 00:01:44,797</div><div>Call it insets and the definition of the</div><div>class here.</div><div><br /></div><div>11</div><div>00:01:44,797 --&gt; 00:01:50,476</div><div>What you see, what's particular is that</div><div>we've given you two definitions of</div><div><br /></div><div>12</div><div>00:01:50,476 --&gt; 00:01:54,731</div><div>functions, but they do not have a body.</div><div>The equals is missing and the body is</div><div><br /></div><div>13</div><div>00:01:54,731 --&gt; 00:01:59,685</div><div>missing, and that's permissible as long as</div><div>the class is abstract.</div><div><br /></div><div>14</div><div>00:01:59,685 --&gt; 00:02:05,498</div><div>If I would remove the abstract, I would</div><div>get a problem which would say, class inset</div><div><br /></div><div>15</div><div>00:02:05,498 --&gt; 00:02:11,219</div><div>needs to be abstract since method contains</div><div>is not defined and method include is not</div><div><br /></div><div>16</div><div>00:02:11,219 --&gt; 00:02:15,712</div><div>defined.</div><div>So, let's add the abstract again.</div><div><br /></div><div>17</div><div>00:02:15,712 --&gt; 00:02:23,577</div><div>So, you've seen that abstract glasses can</div><div>contain members which are missing in</div><div><br /></div><div>18</div><div>00:02:23,577 --&gt; 00:02:27,371</div><div>implementation.</div><div>On the other hand, we get instances of an</div><div><br /></div><div>19</div><div>00:02:27,371 --&gt; 00:02:34,668</div><div>abstract glass with the operator new.</div><div>So, if you would try that.</div><div><br /></div><div>20</div><div>00:02:34,668 --&gt; 00:02:42,809</div><div>Write here, new inset.</div><div>I will get an error, which says that the</div><div><br /></div><div>21</div><div>00:02:42,809 --&gt; 00:02:46,699</div><div>class inset is abstract and cannot be</div><div>instantiated.</div><div><br /></div><div>22</div><div>00:02:46,699 --&gt; 00:02:50,920</div><div>So, since inset is incomplete, how would</div><div>we implement it?</div><div><br /></div><div>23</div><div>00:02:50,920 --&gt; 00:02:56,674</div><div>Well, one way to do that would be using</div><div>the binary tree data structure.</div><div><br /></div><div>24</div><div>00:02:56,674 --&gt; 00:03:00,887</div><div>In the data structure, there are two types</div><div>of possible tree.</div><div><br /></div><div>25</div><div>00:03:00,887 --&gt; 00:03:07,306</div><div>A tree that represents the empty set and a</div><div>tree that consists of an integer and two</div><div><br /></div><div>26</div><div>00:03:07,306 --&gt; 00:03:13,882</div><div>subtrees and the idea would be that you</div><div>keep always the invariant that the trees</div><div><br /></div><div>27</div><div>00:03:13,882 --&gt; 00:03:17,421</div><div>are sorted.</div><div>So, that means if I give you an example</div><div><br /></div><div>28</div><div>00:03:17,421 --&gt; 00:03:24,079</div><div>here, we would have a tree, let's say,</div><div>with a seven, and that would have a two</div><div><br /></div><div>29</div><div>00:03:24,079 --&gt; 00:03:30,740</div><div>subtrees, and here, we would have maybe an</div><div>eleven, and here we would have five.</div><div><br /></div><div>30</div><div>00:03:30,740 --&gt; 00:03:40,701</div><div>And then, the eleven could have one, nine.</div><div>And the response would all be empty.</div><div><br /></div><div>31</div><div>00:03:48,012 --&gt; 00:03:53,024</div><div>So, that's an example of a binary tree.</div><div>And the invariant that we want to maintain</div><div><br /></div><div>32</div><div>00:03:53,024 --&gt; 00:03:58,337</div><div>is that for each node, the nodes on the</div><div>right-hand side of this node, all have</div><div><br /></div><div>33</div><div>00:03:58,337 --&gt; 00:04:01,058</div><div>integer values that are higher than the</div><div>node.</div><div><br /></div><div>34</div><div>00:04:01,058 --&gt; 00:04:06,089</div><div>Whereas, the nodes on the left-hand side</div><div>all have values that are less than the</div><div><br /></div><div>35</div><div>00:04:06,089 --&gt; 00:04:09,091</div><div>node.</div><div>Now, that this will make it easier later</div><div><br /></div><div>36</div><div>00:04:09,091 --&gt; 00:04:15,043</div><div>on to implement, the contains test that</div><div>determines whether a given value is in the</div><div><br /></div><div>37</div><div>00:04:15,043 --&gt; 00:04:18,516</div><div>tree.</div><div>So, let's start with the empty tree here.</div><div><br /></div><div>38</div><div>00:04:18,516 --&gt; 00:04:21,389</div><div>The empty tree is very simple to</div><div>implement, we would simply say that</div><div><br /></div><div>39</div><div>00:04:21,389 --&gt; 00:04:27,387</div><div>contains is always false, because the</div><div>empty tree does, cannot contain any value.</div><div><br /></div><div>40</div><div>00:04:27,387 --&gt; 00:04:32,238</div><div>Whereas, include is a method that returns</div><div>an inset.</div><div><br /></div><div>41</div><div>00:04:32,238 --&gt; 00:04:37,706</div><div>So, what set would it return?</div><div>Well, it would return a non-empty set to</div><div><br /></div><div>42</div><div>00:04:37,706 --&gt; 00:04:43,480</div><div>be defined, that contains the given</div><div>element and two empty subtrees.</div><div><br /></div><div>43</div><div>00:04:43,480 --&gt; 00:04:51,093</div><div>So, going from the empty set to an include</div><div>set, would give us a set like that, that</div><div><br /></div><div>44</div><div>00:04:51,093 --&gt; 00:04:55,400</div><div>contains a single node and two empty</div><div>subnodes.</div><div><br /></div><div>45</div><div>00:04:55,400 --&gt; 00:05:08,007</div><div>Let's put that class into the worksheet.</div><div>Now, it still remains to define what a</div><div><br /></div><div>46</div><div>00:05:08,007 --&gt; 00:05:14,316</div><div>non-empty set would be.</div><div>A non-empty set in that implementation,</div><div><br /></div><div>47</div><div>00:05:14,316 --&gt; 00:05:20,291</div><div>would be represented by a class non-empty</div><div>that takes an element, that's the integer</div><div><br /></div><div>48</div><div>00:05:20,291 --&gt; 00:05:26,276</div><div>stored in the node, and the left and the</div><div>right subtree which is, in each case, an</div><div><br /></div><div>49</div><div>00:05:26,276 --&gt; 00:05:29,283</div><div>inset.</div><div>And the implementation of contains and</div><div><br /></div><div>50</div><div>00:05:29,283 --&gt; 00:05:33,251</div><div>includes now makes use of the sorted</div><div>criterion of trees.</div><div><br /></div><div>51</div><div>00:05:33,251 --&gt; 00:05:38,236</div><div>So that means that, for contains, we</div><div>always have to look only in one of the</div><div><br /></div><div>52</div><div>00:05:38,236 --&gt; 00:05:41,310</div><div>possible subtrees.</div><div>If the given number x is less than the</div><div><br /></div><div>53</div><div>00:05:41,310 --&gt; 00:05:46,308</div><div>current element value, then we know we</div><div>will have to look in the left subtree</div><div><br /></div><div>54</div><div>00:05:46,308 --&gt; 00:05:49,304</div><div>here.</div><div>Whereas, if it's greater, we know we will</div><div><br /></div><div>55</div><div>00:05:49,304 --&gt; 00:05:54,296</div><div>have to look in the right subtree.</div><div>If it's neither less nor greater than, it</div><div><br /></div><div>56</div><div>00:05:54,296 --&gt; 00:05:57,317</div><div>must be equal.</div><div>And in this case, we have found the</div><div><br /></div><div>57</div><div>00:05:57,317 --&gt; 00:06:00,322</div><div>element.</div><div>The include method follows a similar</div><div><br /></div><div>58</div><div>00:06:00,322 --&gt; 00:06:04,264</div><div>algorithm.</div><div>If the element to be added is less than</div><div><br /></div><div>59</div><div>00:06:04,264 --&gt; 00:06:09,255</div><div>the element in the tree then we need to</div><div>include it in the left subtree.</div><div><br /></div><div>60</div><div>00:06:09,255 --&gt; 00:06:13,272</div><div>If it is greater, we need to include it in</div><div>the right subtree.</div><div><br /></div><div>61</div><div>00:06:13,272 --&gt; 00:06:19,232</div><div>And otherwise, the element is already in</div><div>the tree and we can return the tree as is.</div><div><br /></div><div>62</div><div>00:06:19,232 --&gt; 00:06:21,153</div><div>There's nothing that needs to be added.</div><div><br /></div><div>63</div><div>00:06:21,153 --&gt; 00:06:26,205</div><div>One important aspect here is that we are</div><div>still purely functional, there is no</div><div><br /></div><div>64</div><div>00:06:26,205 --&gt; 00:06:29,853</div><div>mutation.</div><div>So, when I say, we include an element in</div><div><br /></div><div>65</div><div>00:06:29,853 --&gt; 00:06:34,967</div><div>the left subtree, what I really mean is</div><div>that we create a new tree that contains</div><div><br /></div><div>66</div><div>00:06:34,967 --&gt; 00:06:40,701</div><div>the previous element of the tree and a</div><div>larger left subtree, where x is included</div><div><br /></div><div>67</div><div>00:06:40,701 --&gt; 00:06:47,162</div><div>in the previous left subtree and the</div><div>current subtree on the right.</div><div><br /></div><div>68</div><div>00:06:47,162 --&gt; 00:06:55,129</div><div>So, visually, if I would say, include the</div><div>number three in the tree that we see here.</div><div><br /></div><div>69</div><div>00:06:55,129 --&gt; 00:07:03,008</div><div>Then, what would happen is I would create</div><div>a new node three with two empty subtrees.</div><div><br /></div><div>70</div><div>00:07:03,008 --&gt; 00:07:11,290</div><div>That subtree would be the left subtree of</div><div>a new node with element five, and an empty</div><div><br /></div><div>71</div><div>00:07:11,290 --&gt; 00:07:17,253</div><div>right-hand subtree.</div><div>And, finally, my tree would be a new tree</div><div><br /></div><div>72</div><div>00:07:17,253 --&gt; 00:07:23,427</div><div>with the, as before the node seven is the</div><div>node and the same as the right-hand side</div><div><br /></div><div>73</div><div>00:07:23,427 --&gt; 00:07:26,600</div><div>tree here.</div><div>So, we see that now, we really have two</div><div><br /></div><div>74</div><div>00:07:26,600 --&gt; 00:07:30,093</div><div>trees, the old one and the new one after</div><div>the include.</div><div><br /></div><div>75</div><div>00:07:30,093 --&gt; 00:07:37,205</div><div>The two trees share the sub tree here on</div><div>the right hand side but they differ in the</div><div><br /></div><div>76</div><div>00:07:37,205 --&gt; 00:07:43,300</div><div>left tree, where, on the new tree, we have</div><div>a three in the left most bottom corner</div><div><br /></div><div>77</div><div>00:07:43,300 --&gt; 00:07:47,220</div><div>whereas, for the old tree, we just have</div><div>two empty trees.</div><div><br /></div><div>78</div><div>00:07:47,220 --&gt; 00:07:56,411</div><div>One way these data structures are called,</div><div>are called persistent data structures,</div><div><br /></div><div>79</div><div>00:07:56,411 --&gt; 00:08:06,177</div><div>because even when we do changes or</div><div>so-called changes in quotes to a data</div><div><br /></div><div>80</div><div>00:08:06,177 --&gt; 00:08:11,034</div><div>structure, the old version of the data</div><div>structure is still maintained.</div><div><br /></div><div>81</div><div>00:08:11,034 --&gt; 00:08:14,905</div><div>It doesn't go away.</div><div>And persistent data structures are</div><div><br /></div><div>82</div><div>00:08:14,905 --&gt; 00:08:21,239</div><div>actually one of the cornerstone of scaling</div><div>functional programming up to collections</div><div><br /></div><div>83</div><div>00:08:21,239 --&gt; 00:08:25,018</div><div>and the like.</div><div>So, let's take the definition of class</div><div><br /></div><div>84</div><div>00:08:25,018 --&gt; 00:08:33,205</div><div>non-empty and also, add it in the</div><div>worksheet so that we can test something.</div><div><br /></div><div>85</div><div>00:08:33,205 --&gt; 00:08:43,816</div><div>So now, instead of new inset, I would</div><div>create a set by saying, well, if this</div><div><br /></div><div>86</div><div>00:08:43,816 --&gt; 00:08:53,838</div><div>would be, maybe, new non-empty of three,</div><div>new empty, new empty, so it would be my</div><div><br /></div><div>87</div><div>00:08:53,838 --&gt; 00:09:01,133</div><div>first set.</div><div>I would give me non-empty set, and I could</div><div><br /></div><div>88</div><div>00:09:01,133 --&gt; 00:09:12,202</div><div>then write things like include a four, and</div><div>that would give me an inset, which is</div><div><br /></div><div>89</div><div>00:09:12,202 --&gt; 00:09:17,195</div><div>another non-empty set.</div><div>Now, before we go further, let's add a two</div><div><br /></div><div>90</div><div>00:09:17,195 --&gt; 00:09:24,136</div><div>string operation to our set so that we can</div><div>actually see what sets we have created</div><div><br /></div><div>91</div><div>00:09:24,136 --&gt; 00:09:27,172</div><div>here.</div><div>We need two definitions of two string.</div><div><br /></div><div>92</div><div>00:09:27,172 --&gt; 00:09:35,151</div><div>One in empty, and one in non-empty.</div><div>For empty, how would we define two string?</div><div><br /></div><div>93</div><div>00:09:35,151 --&gt; 00:09:43,196</div><div>Well, let me just define it in a very</div><div>minimalistic way to give you a period.</div><div><br /></div><div>94</div><div>00:09:43,196 --&gt; 00:09:51,142</div><div>For non-empty, I want to define two string</div><div>as follows.</div><div><br /></div><div>95</div><div>00:09:51,142 --&gt; 00:09:59,597</div><div>I want to say it should be an open brace</div><div>followed by the, the description of the</div><div><br /></div><div>96</div><div>00:09:59,597 --&gt; 00:10:06,193</div><div>left element followed by the, sorry, as</div><div>follows.</div><div><br /></div><div>97</div><div>00:10:06,193 --&gt; 00:10:15,249</div><div>It should be an open brace followed by the</div><div>string value of the left subtree and the</div><div><br /></div><div>98</div><div>00:10:15,249 --&gt; 00:10:22,150</div><div>element in the middle in the right</div><div>subtree, and then, a closing brace.</div><div><br /></div><div>99</div><div>00:10:22,208 --&gt; 00:10:30,136</div><div>If we do that, then we see that here we</div><div>get a sort of visual representation of our</div><div><br /></div><div>100</div><div>00:10:30,136 --&gt; 00:10:34,144</div><div>tree.</div><div>So, the first t1 would be an element tree,</div><div><br /></div><div>101</div><div>00:10:34,144 --&gt; 00:10:40,436</div><div>and empty tree to the left and right.</div><div>Whereas, t2 would be the root of t2 would</div><div><br /></div><div>102</div><div>00:10:40,436 --&gt; 00:10:46,142</div><div>be three, the right subtree is a tree that</div><div>has four as its element.</div><div><br /></div><div>103</div><div>00:10:46,142 --&gt; 00:10:52,839</div><div>So, we see that this tree, in particular,</div><div>has maintained the invariant that trees</div><div><br /></div><div>104</div><div>00:10:52,839 --&gt; 00:10:57,671</div><div>are sorted.</div><div>So, one new thing you see here is that</div><div><br /></div><div>105</div><div>00:10:57,671 --&gt; 00:11:05,152</div><div>both empty and non-empty extend inset.</div><div>So, extension means that these two classes</div><div><br /></div><div>106</div><div>00:11:05,152 --&gt; 00:11:12,198</div><div>are subclasses of the base class inset.</div><div>One consequence of that is that the types,</div><div><br /></div><div>107</div><div>00:11:12,198 --&gt; 00:11:16,216</div><div>empty and non-empty, conform to the type</div><div>inset.</div><div><br /></div><div>108</div><div>00:11:16,216 --&gt; 00:11:24,189</div><div>What that means is that an object of type</div><div>empty or non-empty can be used wherever an</div><div><br /></div><div>109</div><div>00:11:24,189 --&gt; 00:11:32,129</div><div>object of type inset is required.</div><div>Some more terminology.</div><div><br /></div><div>110</div><div>00:11:32,129 --&gt; 00:11:37,215</div><div>We say, insert is the super class of empty</div><div>and non-empty, and empty and nonempty are</div><div><br /></div><div>111</div><div>00:11:37,215 --&gt; 00:11:42,214</div><div>the subclasses of inset.</div><div>In Scala, any class that you can define</div><div><br /></div><div>112</div><div>00:11:42,214 --&gt; 00:11:47,164</div><div>extends another class.</div><div>Even for a class like rational, where you</div><div><br /></div><div>113</div><div>00:11:47,164 --&gt; 00:11:51,142</div><div>didn't give an extends clause, there is a</div><div>superclass.</div><div><br /></div><div>114</div><div>00:11:51,142 --&gt; 00:11:56,191</div><div>So, if no explicit superclass is given,</div><div>the standard class object in the Java</div><div><br /></div><div>115</div><div>00:11:56,191 --&gt; 00:12:01,590</div><div>package, Java language is assumed.</div><div>Object is the root class of all Java</div><div><br /></div><div>116</div><div>00:12:01,590 --&gt; 00:12:05,678</div><div>class, and also of all user-defined Scala</div><div>classes.</div><div><br /></div><div>117</div><div>00:12:05,678 --&gt; 00:12:10,809</div><div>If you take the direct superclass of a</div><div>class and then its superclass and so on,</div><div><br /></div><div>118</div><div>00:12:10,809 --&gt; 00:12:15,784</div><div>so all the direct and indirect super</div><div>classes of a class C, then these are</div><div><br /></div><div>119</div><div>00:12:15,784 --&gt; 00:12:20,937</div><div>called that the base classes of C.</div><div>So, for instance, the base classes of</div><div><br /></div><div>120</div><div>00:12:20,937 --&gt; 00:12:27,863</div><div>class non-empty or insert and then object.</div><div>So, what you've seen in the example is</div><div><br /></div><div>121</div><div>00:12:27,863 --&gt; 00:12:33,234</div><div>that the definitions of, contains and</div><div>including classes empty and non-empty,</div><div><br /></div><div>122</div><div>00:12:33,234 --&gt; 00:12:39,228</div><div>implement the abstraction functions in the</div><div>base class insert, they were not to be</div><div><br /></div><div>123</div><div>00:12:39,228 --&gt; 00:12:44,909</div><div>find in insert but they, they are</div><div>implemented in the subclasses, empty and</div><div><br /></div><div>124</div><div>00:12:44,909 --&gt; 00:12:49,196</div><div>nonempty.</div><div>It's also possible to redefine an existing</div><div><br /></div><div>125</div><div>00:12:49,196 --&gt; 00:12:56,118</div><div>non-abstract definition of a superclass in</div><div>a subclass, but then, you have to use</div><div><br /></div><div>126</div><div>00:12:56,118 --&gt; 00:12:59,215</div><div>overwrite.</div><div>So, in this example here, you see the, the</div><div><br /></div><div>127</div><div>00:12:59,215 --&gt; 00:13:03,176</div><div>difference.</div><div>If you write in the base class, foo = one.</div><div><br /></div><div>128</div><div>00:13:03,178 --&gt; 00:13:09,169</div><div>And then you redefine foo in the subclass,</div><div>which, which extends base, then you have</div><div><br /></div><div>129</div><div>00:13:09,169 --&gt; 00:13:14,128</div><div>to put an overwrite.</div><div>So, let me demonstrate that to you in this</div><div><br /></div><div>130</div><div>00:13:14,128 --&gt; 00:13:17,494</div><div>worksheet.</div><div>We have two classes, a base class and a</div><div><br /></div><div>131</div><div>00:13:17,494 --&gt; 00:13:21,175</div><div>subclass.</div><div>And each of these classes have two members</div><div><br /></div><div>132</div><div>00:13:21,175 --&gt; 00:13:25,852</div><div>named foo and bar.</div><div>The bar member in class sub, implements</div><div><br /></div><div>133</div><div>00:13:25,852 --&gt; 00:13:30,216</div><div>the abstract definition of bar in class</div><div>base.</div><div><br /></div><div>134</div><div>00:13:30,216 --&gt; 00:13:37,500</div><div>Whereas, the full member replaces the</div><div>concrete definition of who in class base.</div><div><br /></div><div>135</div><div>00:13:37,500 --&gt; 00:13:44,048</div><div>If a member replaces or overwrites the</div><div>definition in a superclass, then the</div><div><br /></div><div>136</div><div>00:13:44,048 --&gt; 00:13:49,425</div><div>override here is mandatory.</div><div>So let's say, say I leave that out,</div><div><br /></div><div>137</div><div>00:13:49,425 --&gt; 00:13:52,610</div><div>compile.</div><div>And we will get an error which says,</div><div><br /></div><div>138</div><div>00:13:52,610 --&gt; 00:13:58,199</div><div>overwriting might method foo in class base</div><div>the method foo here needs an overwrite</div><div><br /></div><div>139</div><div>00:13:58,199 --&gt; 00:14:00,160</div><div>modifier.</div><div>So, why is that?</div><div><br /></div><div>140</div><div>00:14:00,160 --&gt; 00:14:03,223</div><div>Why here Scala is actually more picky than</div><div>Java?</div><div><br /></div><div>141</div><div>00:14:03,223 --&gt; 00:14:09,133</div><div>Well, the reason is that sometimes we do</div><div>not really know what methods you do</div><div><br /></div><div>142</div><div>00:14:09,133 --&gt; 00:14:11,222</div><div>inherit.</div><div>So, you might actually accidentally</div><div><br /></div><div>143</div><div>00:14:11,222 --&gt; 00:14:17,159</div><div>overwrite a method in a base class, and in</div><div>that case, is good that you have to be</div><div><br /></div><div>144</div><div>00:14:17,159 --&gt; 00:14:21,155</div><div>explicit about it.</div><div>There's an added benefit namely when you</div><div><br /></div><div>145</div><div>00:14:21,155 --&gt; 00:14:26,213</div><div>intent to overwrite but let's say, you</div><div>can't remember the name correctly or you</div><div><br /></div><div>146</div><div>00:14:26,213 --&gt; 00:14:30,217</div><div>get the numbers of parameters wrong, or</div><div>things like that.</div><div><br /></div><div>147</div><div>00:14:30,217 --&gt; 00:14:35,693</div><div>So, if I write something like that,</div><div>overwrite the foo two, then I get an error</div><div><br /></div><div>148</div><div>00:14:35,693 --&gt; 00:14:38,597</div><div>again.</div><div>Where we say, method foo2 overwrites</div><div><br /></div><div>149</div><div>00:14:38,597 --&gt; 00:14:41,777</div><div>nothing.</div><div>So, in that case the ovewrite will give me</div><div><br /></div><div>150</div><div>00:14:41,777 --&gt; 00:14:47,422</div><div>the opposite protection results when I</div><div>write overwrite then I want to be sure</div><div><br /></div><div>151</div><div>00:14:47,422 --&gt; 00:14:50,990</div><div>that, in fact, I do overwrite another</div><div>definition.</div><div><br /></div><div>152</div><div>00:14:50,990 --&gt; 00:14:56,889</div><div>For methods that implement definitions in</div><div>base classes, the overwrite is optional,</div><div><br /></div><div>153</div><div>00:14:56,889 --&gt; 00:15:01,446</div><div>you can write it if you want to.</div><div>And, in that case, you will be warned in</div><div><br /></div><div>154</div><div>00:15:01,446 --&gt; 00:15:04,930</div><div>the same way.</div><div>So, if I write part two, I will get an</div><div><br /></div><div>155</div><div>00:15:04,930 --&gt; 00:15:08,324</div><div>error as before.</div><div>But you don't have to do that.</div><div><br /></div><div>156</div><div>00:15:08,324 --&gt; 00:15:13,510</div><div>So, you don't need to write the overwrite,</div><div>you could just write def bar.</div><div><br /></div><div>157</div><div>00:15:13,510 --&gt; 00:15:16,744</div><div>And that's usually less noisy, so,</div><div>preferred.</div><div><br /></div><div>158</div><div>00:15:16,744 --&gt; 00:15:22,263</div><div>So, let's get back to the insets example.</div><div>One thing to improve would be the status</div><div><br /></div><div>159</div><div>00:15:22,263 --&gt; 00:15:26,937</div><div>of the empty inset class.</div><div>You could argue that there's really only a</div><div><br /></div><div>160</div><div>00:15:26,937 --&gt; 00:15:31,028</div><div>single empty inset.</div><div>So, it seems overkill to have the user</div><div><br /></div><div>161</div><div>00:15:31,028 --&gt; 00:15:35,614</div><div>create many instances of it.</div><div>And, in fact, that's very easy to achieve</div><div><br /></div><div>162</div><div>00:15:35,614 --&gt; 00:15:38,826</div><div>in Scala.</div><div>You just use an object definition instead</div><div><br /></div><div>163</div><div>00:15:38,826 --&gt; 00:15:45,164</div><div>of a class definition as before.</div><div>So, this object definition is exactly the</div><div><br /></div><div>164</div><div>00:15:45,164 --&gt; 00:15:51,155</div><div>same as the class definition, except that</div><div>instead of the keyword class, you use</div><div><br /></div><div>165</div><div>00:15:51,155 --&gt; 00:15:55,126</div><div>object.</div><div>And that will define a single item object</div><div><br /></div><div>166</div><div>00:15:55,126 --&gt; 00:15:58,204</div><div>named empty.</div><div>There is only one of them and you don't</div><div><br /></div><div>167</div><div>00:15:58,204 --&gt; 00:16:02,137</div><div>need or can create that explicitly with</div><div>new.</div><div><br /></div><div>168</div><div>00:16:02,137 --&gt; 00:16:07,190</div><div>So the object empty simply exists,</div><div>technically it will be created the first</div><div><br /></div><div>169</div><div>00:16:07,190 --&gt; 00:16:12,223</div><div>time you reference it.</div><div>Your reference to the object simply by</div><div><br /></div><div>170</div><div>00:16:12,223 --&gt; 00:16:17,373</div><div>naming it with empty.</div><div>So, empty here and here replaces the</div><div><br /></div><div>171</div><div>00:16:17,373 --&gt; 00:16:26,168</div><div>creation of new MT that we had before.</div><div>In terms of evaluation, singleton objects</div><div><br /></div><div>172</div><div>00:16:26,168 --&gt; 00:16:30,181</div><div>are values.</div><div>So, empty is already a value, there's no</div><div><br /></div><div>173</div><div>00:16:30,181 --&gt; 00:16:34,137</div><div>evaluation step that needs to be</div><div>performed.</div><div><br /></div><div>174</div><div>00:16:34,137 --&gt; 00:16:38,801</div><div>So, since we're already looking at objects</div><div>let's, take a quick excursion and look at</div><div><br /></div><div>175</div><div>00:16:38,801 --&gt; 00:16:44,410</div><div>what a program would be in Scala So far,</div><div>we've executed all Scala code from the</div><div><br /></div><div>176</div><div>00:16:44,410 --&gt; 00:16:49,206</div><div>RPEL or the worksheet, but it's also</div><div>possible to create standalone</div><div><br /></div><div>177</div><div>00:16:49,206 --&gt; 00:16:52,652</div><div>applications.</div><div>Each as applications would contain an</div><div><br /></div><div>178</div><div>00:16:52,652 --&gt; 00:16:55,658</div><div>object and that object contains a main</div><div>method.</div><div><br /></div><div>179</div><div>00:16:55,658 --&gt; 00:17:00,674</div><div>Let's look at this with the mandatory</div><div>Hello World Program written in Scala.</div><div><br /></div><div>180</div><div>00:17:00,674 --&gt; 00:17:03,579</div><div>So, you would write an object, name it</div><div>Hello.</div><div><br /></div><div>181</div><div>00:17:03,579 --&gt; 00:17:08,579</div><div>It has a main method, then as in java,</div><div>that main method will have to take an</div><div><br /></div><div>182</div><div>00:17:08,579 --&gt; 00:17:11,941</div><div>array of string, you can ignore that for</div><div>the time being.</div><div><br /></div><div>183</div><div>00:17:11,941 --&gt; 00:17:16,183</div><div>And the body of the main method would be a</div><div>println with Hello World.</div><div><br /></div><div>184</div><div>00:17:16,183 --&gt; 00:17:21,878</div><div>Once you compile this program, you can</div><div>start it from the command line simply with</div><div><br /></div><div>185</div><div>00:17:21,878 --&gt; 00:17:26,366</div><div>Scala, and then Hello.</div><div>Or you could also use Java and Hello, they</div><div><br /></div><div>186</div><div>00:17:26,366 --&gt; 00:17:28,738</div><div>would do the same thing in this case.</div><div><br /></div><div>187</div><div>00:17:28,738 --&gt; 00:17:31,927</div><div>So, let me demonstrate that in</div><div>Eclipse.</div><div><br /></div><div>188</div><div>00:17:31,927 --&gt; 00:17:35,367</div><div>So, we create in the Week three package,</div><div><br /></div><div>189</div><div>00:17:35,367 --&gt; 00:17:42,407</div><div>this time not a worksheet but a Scala</div><div>object, call it, Hello.</div><div><br /></div><div>190</div><div>00:17:45,363 --&gt; 00:17:51,440</div><div>And then, we have to add the main function</div><div>which takes this.</div><div><br /></div><div>191</div><div>00:17:52,368 --&gt; 00:18:04,796</div><div>And it would print something.</div><div>We can run this program as a program using</div><div><br /></div><div>192</div><div>00:18:04,796 --&gt; 00:18:10,032</div><div>the green arrow here.</div><div>So, we will run it as a Scala application,</div><div><br /></div><div>193</div><div>00:18:10,032 --&gt; 00:18:16,647</div><div>and we see on the console, Hello World.</div><div>So, that's how you would run full programs</div><div><br /></div><div>194</div><div>00:18:16,647 --&gt; 00:18:19,991</div><div>in Scala from Eclipse.</div><div><br /></div><div>195</div><div>00:18:19,991 --&gt; 00:18:24,551</div><div>So, let's do an exercise.</div><div>The task is to add a new method to our</div><div><br /></div><div>196</div><div>00:18:24,551 --&gt; 00:18:29,865</div><div>insert class hierarchy.</div><div>The method should take the union of a set</div><div><br /></div><div>197</div><div>00:18:29,865 --&gt; 00:18:35,126</div><div>and some other set.</div><div>So, you should extend the class insert to</div><div><br /></div><div>198</div><div>00:18:35,126 --&gt; 00:18:40,600</div><div>be the following abstract class and</div><div>implement that.</div><div><br /></div><div>199</div><div>00:18:40,600 --&gt; 00:18:51,596</div><div>So, how we would we go about that?</div><div>Let's first start with the abstract class.</div><div><br /></div><div>200</div><div>00:18:51,596 --&gt; 00:19:00,027</div><div>So, here's the signature of union.</div><div>And now, we get two errors because we have</div><div><br /></div><div>201</div><div>00:19:00,027 --&gt; 00:19:05,751</div><div>to implement it in the two sub classes.</div><div>So, let's start with empty.</div><div><br /></div><div>202</div><div>00:19:05,751 --&gt; 00:19:11,269</div><div>What would the union of an empty set and</div><div>some other set be?</div><div><br /></div><div>203</div><div>00:19:11,269 --&gt; 00:19:19,176</div><div>Well, that's very simple, empty set union</div><div>some other set is always the other set.</div><div><br /></div><div>204</div><div>00:19:19,176 --&gt; 00:19:21,273</div><div>So, for non-empty sets, how would we</div><div><br /></div><div>205</div><div>00:19:21,273 --&gt; 00:19:28,189</div><div>define union in this case?</div><div>Well, the idea is that we split the set</div><div><br /></div><div>206</div><div>00:19:28,189 --&gt; 00:19:33,209</div><div>into its constituents.</div><div>So, we have the left inset, the right</div><div><br /></div><div>207</div><div>00:19:33,209 --&gt; 00:19:37,254</div><div>inset, and the element.</div><div>Let's form the union instead from</div><div><br /></div><div>208</div><div>00:19:37,254 --&gt; 00:19:41,250</div><div>something that is smaller.</div><div>So, one of the subsets.</div><div><br /></div><div>209</div><div>00:19:41,250 --&gt; 00:19:48,243</div><div>Let's start with left and two union right.</div><div>So, that would give us the set without the</div><div><br /></div><div>210</div><div>00:19:48,243 --&gt; 00:19:53,213</div><div>initial element.</div><div>Then, let's finally give the union of the</div><div><br /></div><div>211</div><div>00:19:53,213 --&gt; 00:20:00,797</div><div>other set.</div><div>And as a last action, action, let's</div><div><br /></div><div>212</div><div>00:20:00,797 --&gt; 00:20:07,246</div><div>include the element back into the set.</div><div>So, the new union has all the parts of the</div><div><br /></div><div>213</div><div>00:20:07,246 --&gt; 00:20:13,190</div><div>previous ones that contain the left set,</div><div>it contains the right set, it contains the</div><div><br /></div><div>214</div><div>00:20:13,190 --&gt; 00:20:18,208</div><div>element, and it contains the other set.</div><div>So, it's very easy to convince ourselves</div><div><br /></div><div>215</div><div>00:20:18,208 --&gt; 00:20:23,885</div><div>that indeed the two the, the, the results</div><div>set here would have all the elements of</div><div><br /></div><div>216</div><div>00:20:23,885 --&gt; 00:20:26,639</div><div>the union and would have no other</div><div>elements.</div><div><br /></div><div>217</div><div>00:20:26,639 --&gt; 00:20:31,848</div><div>But there's another concern and that is</div><div>well, how do we know that this recursion</div><div><br /></div><div>218</div><div>00:20:31,848 --&gt; 00:20:36,565</div><div>actually terminates, because after all,</div><div>union calls union and we've seen already,</div><div><br /></div><div>219</div><div>00:20:36,565 --&gt; 00:20:40,239</div><div>cases where calling yourself again would</div><div>not terminate.</div><div><br /></div><div>220</div><div>00:20:40,239 --&gt; 00:20:45,251</div><div>So, the argument you, we could make here</div><div>is to say, well, every call to union is</div><div><br /></div><div>221</div><div>00:20:45,251 --&gt; 00:20:50,197</div><div>actually on something that is smaller than</div><div>the set we started with.</div><div><br /></div><div>222</div><div>00:20:50,197 --&gt; 00:20:55,279</div><div>The first call to union was on the left</div><div>subtree here, and obviously, that set is</div><div><br /></div><div>223</div><div>00:20:55,279 --&gt; 00:21:00,563</div><div>smaller than the whole non-empty set.</div><div>The second call to union was on the union</div><div><br /></div><div>224</div><div>00:21:00,563 --&gt; 00:21:06,510</div><div>in left and right, and then again contains</div><div>one element less than the full set that we</div><div><br /></div><div>225</div><div>00:21:06,510 --&gt; 00:21:10,583</div><div>have here.</div><div>Because every union, every quarter union</div><div><br /></div><div>226</div><div>00:21:10,583 --&gt; 00:21:15,639</div><div>is on a set that is smaller, it follows</div><div>that, at some point, we have to reach</div><div><br /></div><div>227</div><div>00:21:15,639 --&gt; 00:21:19,192</div><div>zero.</div><div>And if the set is zero, then we fall back</div><div><br /></div><div>228</div><div>00:21:19,192 --&gt; 00:21:24,966</div><div>to the case of empty sets where the union</div><div>is immediate, we just return the other</div><div><br /></div><div>229</div><div>00:21:24,966 --&gt; 00:21:28,179</div><div>set.</div><div>So, that's how we convince ourselves that</div><div><br /></div><div>230</div><div>00:21:28,179 --&gt; 00:21:33,169</div><div>the union that we, operations that we do</div><div>here are in fact terminating.</div><div><br /></div><div>231</div><div>00:21:33,169 --&gt; 00:21:38,223</div><div>And once those are terminating, we can</div><div>safely add element back with an include</div><div><br /></div><div>232</div><div>00:21:38,223 --&gt; 00:21:43,777</div><div>operation as before, okay.</div><div>What object oriented language is do in</div><div><br /></div><div>233</div><div>00:21:43,777 --&gt; 00:21:47,875</div><div>this case?</div><div>Scala included, is to use th dynamic</div><div><br /></div><div>234</div><div>00:21:47,875 --&gt; 00:21:52,969</div><div>method dispatch model.</div><div>That means, that the code that's invoked</div><div><br /></div><div>235</div><div>00:21:52,969 --&gt; 00:21:58,000</div><div>by a method call depends on the runtime</div><div>type of the object, that contains the</div><div><br /></div><div>236</div><div>00:21:58,000 --&gt; 00:22:01,624</div><div>method.</div><div>I believe that's best shown in an example.</div><div><br /></div><div>237</div><div>00:22:01,624 --&gt; 00:22:05,400</div><div>So, let's say, you have the code empty</div><div>contains one.</div><div><br /></div><div>238</div><div>00:22:05,400 --&gt; 00:22:11,658</div><div>What do you do?</div><div>Well, you look up the contains method in</div><div><br /></div><div>239</div><div>00:22:11,658 --&gt; 00:22:19,166</div><div>empty.</div><div>Remember that was, remember that was an</div><div><br /></div><div>240</div><div>00:22:19,166 --&gt; 00:22:32,499</div><div>object empty and we had a def contains y =</div><div>False, that was its definition.</div><div><br /></div><div>241</div><div>00:22:32,499 --&gt; 00:22:37,467</div><div>So, looking up that method and performing</div><div>the necessary substitutions, we get False.</div><div><br /></div><div>242</div><div>00:22:37,467 --&gt; 00:22:39,467</div><div>Here is another evaluation using</div><div><br /></div><div>243</div><div>00:22:39,467 --&gt; 00:22:42,663</div><div>non-empty.</div><div>We would have to set non-empty seven,</div><div><br /></div><div>244</div><div>00:22:42,663 --&gt; 00:22:47,096</div><div>empty, empty, and we ask whether it</div><div>contains seven.</div><div><br /></div><div>245</div><div>00:22:47,096 --&gt; 00:22:52,683</div><div>So, if you look back at the definition of</div><div>contain and non-empty, that's what we see</div><div><br /></div><div>246</div><div>00:22:52,683 --&gt; 00:22:56,134</div><div>here.</div><div>And if we apply our substitution rules,</div><div><br /></div><div>247</div><div>00:22:56,134 --&gt; 00:23:02,164</div><div>then it means this call of the method will</div><div>be replaced by the right hand side of the</div><div><br /></div><div>248</div><div>00:23:02,164 --&gt; 00:23:08,156</div><div>contains method, which you see here.</div><div>And at the same time, the substitutions of</div><div><br /></div><div>249</div><div>00:23:08,156 --&gt; 00:23:13,164</div><div>the parameters of the class, and the</div><div>method, and the self-reference.</div><div><br /></div><div>250</div><div>00:23:13,164 --&gt; 00:23:20,127</div><div>So, the three elements that you see here.</div><div>If we perform the substitution, we arrive</div><div><br /></div><div>251</div><div>00:23:20,127 --&gt; 00:23:25,243</div><div>at this expression here.</div><div>So, instead of x and ln we have we, we</div><div><br /></div><div>252</div><div>00:23:25,243 --&gt; 00:23:31,696</div><div>have we see seven in each case, and</div><div>instead of the, this, we see new non,</div><div><br /></div><div>253</div><div>00:23:31,696 --&gt; 00:23:37,141</div><div>non-empty seven, empty, empty.</div><div>If you perform the simplification, we get</div><div><br /></div><div>254</div><div>00:23:37,141 --&gt; 00:23:43,147</div><div>that seven is neither less nor greater</div><div>than seven, so we fall into the else case,</div><div><br /></div><div>255</div><div>00:23:43,147 --&gt; 00:23:48,167</div><div>and we get true.</div><div>So, for the end of this session, here's</div><div><br /></div><div>256</div><div>00:23:48,167 --&gt; 00:23:52,330</div><div>something to ponder.</div><div>You've seen that dynamic dispatch of</div><div><br /></div><div>257</div><div>00:23:52,330 --&gt; 00:23:57,759</div><div>methods in object oriented languages is</div><div>actually quite similar to calls of high</div><div><br /></div><div>258</div><div>00:23:57,759 --&gt; 00:24:01,069</div><div>order functions in pure functional</div><div>languages.</div><div><br /></div><div>259</div><div>00:24:01,069 --&gt; 00:24:07,074</div><div>The similarity is that in both cases, the</div><div>code that gets executed on a functional</div><div><br /></div><div>260</div><div>00:24:07,074 --&gt; 00:24:13,093</div><div>method call is not known statically, it's</div><div>not apparent from the name or the type of</div><div><br /></div><div>261</div><div>00:24:13,093 --&gt; 00:24:18,499</div><div>the thing you called, but it is determined</div><div>by the runtime value that is passed.</div><div><br /></div><div>262</div><div>00:24:18,499 --&gt; 00:24:23,694</div><div>So, it's a fair question whether we can</div><div>implement one concept in terms of the</div><div><br /></div><div>263</div><div>00:24:23,694 --&gt; 00:24:26,807</div><div>other.</div><div>Can we maybe implement objects in terms of</div><div><br /></div><div>264</div><div>00:24:26,807 --&gt; 00:24:31,637</div><div>high order functions or can we implement</div><div>higher order functions in terms of</div><div><br /></div><div>265</div><div>00:24:31,637 --&gt; 00:24:34,257</div><div>objects?</div><div>Or can we maybe go both ways?</div><div><br /></div><div>266</div><div>00:24:34,257 --&gt; 00:24:39,842</div><div>It's a question that is fairly open and</div><div>that has a range of possible answers.</div><div><br /></div><div>267</div><div>00:24:39,842 --&gt; 00:24:46,106</div><div>So, I just let you with that think a</div><div>little bit, bit about it and maybe discuss</div><div><br /></div><div>268</div><div>00:24:46,106 --&gt; 00:24:47,113</div><div>with others.</div><div><br /></div>",NA,NA,NA

Some of these files might be binaries and unreadable, some might be videos, other might be music, yet other might be images, and still other might be documents. Now one could model all these file types are different <em>classes</em>. Only some of theses, however, are printable: printing binaries makes no sense, nor does printing a video, but printing a photo or document does. But there are other properties that some of these files might have in common: some might, for example, be shareable via a certain online service. The more behaviors are introduced, the harder it will become to model all of this in a single-inheritance structure.

The description used in the assignment is actually <em>very </em>precise and <i>less </i>likely to be misunderstood but as you note you do have to speak the language. <br /><br />A set is by definition a mathematical construct so in my opinion there won't be a way to truly understand the nuances of the assignment without approaching it from a mathematical perspective. <br /><br />'All bounded integers within $$s$$': <br /><br />Since our sets are defined by a characteristic function we don't have a way to list the members of the set or even know how many elements are in the set. <span>In fact, a characteristic function can specify an infinite set (e.g. even integers: x =&gt; x % 2 == 0).</span> We can only test to see if a particular integer is in the set and that is what its characteristic function does.<br /><br />In order to implement foreach we therefore have to look at a finite (or bounded) range of possible set members. <span>The assignment template code contains a val labeled </span><b>bound</b> which gives us a way to specify a range of integers to test for membership in $$s$$. <br /><br />'satisfy $$p$$': <br /><br />The predicate $$p$$ is a function that tests a condition on the input value. It returns a boolean, so 'satisfy' means that the test passes and the boolean value will be true. At this point you should be thinking that $$p$$ is defined and acts just like a characteristic function. There is no difference!<br /><br />Once we know if an integer from the bounded range is in $$s$$ (ie. satisfies $$s$$) then we test to see if that integer also satisfies $$p$$. From a mathematical set perspective, <strong>foreach </strong>is testing if the bounded subset of the set $$s$$ is a subset of the set $$p$$.<br /><br />Similarly, from a mathematical set perspective, <strong>exists </strong>is testing if the bounded subset of $$s$$ and the bounded subset of $$p$$ have a non-empty intersection.<br /><br /><br />",NA,NA,NA

In essence, if I understand your response correctly, the gist of the phrase I highlighted was:<br /><br /><i>""Check whether, between the upper and lower bounds, all values within set S are also within set/characteristic function P."" So the ""foreach"" function is testing a complete intersection, where S must be a complete (within bounds) subset of P. Whereas the ""exists"" function must check to see whether there is any intersection at all between the two, of at least a single element (integer)</i><br /><br />Hmm, my complaint about phrasing speaks to excessive parsimony and assumptive knowledge, which are the bane of technical writers. If a phrase is reduced to its minimum possible words, then it is often found to be difficult to comprehend from those not in the field. Even worse, if the original writer is an expert, the phrase may seem to be completely obvious to them, yet may be very difficult to parse for readers not in the field. <br /><br />When words are few, then each must be freighted heavily with meaning, thus I have spent 2 days agonising over the meaning of the word satisfy. Once you clarified the matter, thank you, the meaning of satisfy seems simple and easily grasped, and some may be tempted to say it was obvious in retrospect. But simple is not the same as obvious and it is foolishness to conflate them, otherwise there would have been no debate on whether the earth was flat or round, as once the fact is grasped the curvature can be discerned visually. Thus, while the questions in the assignment were simple, they were never obvious, otherwise a FAQ would not have been needed.<br /> <br />In the past I have found these problems can be resolved by increasing the verbosity slightly (i.e. ~10-15%) so the logic can be carried more clearly. I am not suggesting massive increases, nor superfluous descriptions. Can you please amend the FAQ for this assignment to include these extra clarifications on the second question, so that future students may grok the gist  more quickly.<br /><br />Thanks once again for the clarification",NA,NA,NA

Please pardon any grammar mistakes, as English is a foreign language for me. I know what I've written is somewhat long, but I just find lossless compression quite interesting :) <br /><br /><br />A few general explanations for (lossless) compression algorithms (the <b>bold</b> ones are the ones used in the assignment, the <i>italic</i> ones are their counterparts):<br /><ul><li><b>Static compression</b>: The string is processed once so as to build a frequency table from which the optimal codeTree is made, and a second time afterwards for the actual encoding/compression using the previously built codeTree. To decompress, the frequency table has to be written in the compression's output together with the actual compressed string so that the decompressor (or decoder) can rebuild the codeTree before decompressing the actual string; otherwise it wouldn't be able to know which code has been used for that particular string. This makes the encoding to be optimal, but the compressed output is usually very big for short strings, since the entire frequency table has to be written to the output as well.<br /></li><li><i>Dynamic compression</i>: The string is processed only once, updating the frequency table (and therefore the codeTree) after each character is processed (the compressor ""learns"" the optimal coding as it encodes the string). The frequency table starts always in the same initial state (usually, every character is assigned the frequency 1). Therefore, there is no need for the frequency table to be written in the compressor's output, since the decompressor can just update it in the same way the compressor did and that way there is no ambiguity.<br /></li><li><b>Order-0</b>: The frequencies are simply the number of repetitions of each character along the entire string, i.e. how many times each character appears in the given string. For example, for the string ""abaca"" the frequency table would be { ('a', 3), ('b', 1), ('c', 1) }<br /></li><li><i>Order-N</i>: The frequencies are relative to the context (i.e., the N previous characters) of each repetition of the character. Therefore, the frequency table is <i>much</i> bigger, since there is one table (and one codeTree) for each context. This makes the coding of a (not too short) structured string more optimal, since the distribution of character weights (and therefore length of bit-code) is more adapted to its structure, but unusable for short strings because the frequency table is so long that it may be (much) longer than the original uncompressed string. Usually the first N characters are left uncompressed so as to avoid the problem of their not having an order-N context. For example, for the string ""abaca"" the order-1 frequency table would be: {in context 'a': ('b',1), ('c',1); in context 'b' ('a',1); in context 'c': ('a',1) }<br /></li></ul><br />What we are making in the assignment is a static order-0 Huffman compressor and decompressor.<br />With that in mind, if the entire string contains repetitions of only one character, then that frequency table would have only one entry, and the the resulting codeTree would only have a single (root) node. Therefore, the code for that character is 0-bits long (i.e., it does not need any bits to be represented) and the decoded string can be infered from the frequency table without the need of a code. It follows that the compressor's output would be simply the one-entry frequency table, and no coded binary sequence representing the string.<br />In this case, the Huffman coding degenerates into Run-Length coding of a string that repeats a single character, which is an algorithm that simply writes how long each character repetition is (the Run-Length code of the string ""aaabaa"" would be some representation of: {('a',3), ('b',1), ('a',2)} ). <br /><br />In the exercise, there is no need for the frequency tables to be written to the output, since the decoder reads the encoded string from memory and not from a file (because the encoding and decoding happen in the same program) and gets the codeTree built earlier in the same program. However, this raises an issue if the same algorithm is to be used for actual compression (where one instance of the program encodes and another one decodes, so the encoded string is written to, and read from a file): <i>Since the minimum bit-group in every file is a byte, how would the decompressor know when to stop if the length of encoded output isn't a natural number of bytes?</i> This means that if the string is ""ab"" and the encoded output is just ""01"", there are 6 ""rubbish"" bits in the compressed file, and the decompressor would interpret them as ""a""s or ""b""s and thus produce an eight-character string, which is wrong. <br />The best way to avoid this is for the decompressor to calculate from the frequency tables the length of the original string and stop decompressing when that length is reached (this is impossible if the only thing the decompressor gets is the previously-built codeTree, it has to at least get the length of the original string as well). Another common solution is to add the EndOfFile character to the frequency table and the codeTree, and when that character is decoded, the decompressor stops. However, this is a slightly worse solution, because the frequency tables are one entry longer (due to the added character) and the compressed code is a few bits longer (due to the encoded EOF), thus producing a slightly worse compression ratio.<br /><br />----------------------------------------<br /><br />I hope some of you find this interesting as well, and I recommend for those people to read Matt Mahoney's book on <a href=""http://mattmahoney.net/dc/dce.html"">http://mattmahoney.net/dc/dce.html</a>. Personally, I find the different algorithms for entropy reduction together with arithmetic coding most interesting, as well as Shannon's Information Theory (from which I only know the basics so far).<br /><br />",NA,NA,NA

[Observed Error] org.scalatest.exceptions.TestFailedException: List(Fork(Fork(Leaf(e,1),Leaf(t,2),List(e, t),3),Leaf(x,4),List(e, t, x),7)) did not equal List(Fork(Leaf(e,1),Leaf(t,2),List(e, t),3), Leaf(x,4))

I thought that the test case provided wasn't correct because it missed one last Fork object that combined the previous Fork with Leaf(x,4) (as requested in the assignment).

In my opinion, last and init implementations on the List which are shown in 5.1 lecture are a great example. Very simple and elegant code.<br />Looking at the same examples, the fact that you can match on the content of the class instance (an empty List vs a List with one element or a List with more than an element aka a head and a tail), tells me that matching is not done only by the compiler. There is definitely some compile time trickery since the class needs to be marked as a case class, but I think there is more to it. Maybe there is a trick related to the structure of objects in Scala? I would also be curious to know what is the performance compared to type testing?<br />It would be great if somebody can provide some details on the mechanisms of pattern matching, I am not very successful finding details on this on the internet.",NA,NA,NA

Either I lack the materials, feedback or level of explanation needed to understand the subject, or I am incapable of understanding the subject. If the rest of the assignments are as obtuse as this one, then I'm giving up on this course, because either the return on effort is too low, or I just lack the background to interpret the course material (i.e. I am not a mathematician, so requiring a background in logic processing to interpret the questions, simply makes it too hard).<br /><br />Firstly, after help from Paul, I understood what was needed for the ""forall"" function, and following this it was easy to write, so this means that I understand the recursion approach fine. I could use the same approach (e.g. iterating through the bounds) to solve Exists and Map, but this is not the question.<br /><br />After wasting ages stepping through all of the forum threads trying to understand how to solve Exists, searching StackOverflow, wikipedia, etc, it seems I ideally would solve the exists by calling forall with a not predicate, like:<br /><pre><code> def exists(s: Set, p: Int =&gt; Boolean): Boolean = if(forall(s,!p) false, true</code></pre>but unfortunately, this type of statement is not valid as the ""not p"" is not recognised. So, something is either wrong with my understanding of the <span>existential and universal classifiers, which is highly likely, or my approach is right but my conversion to code is wrong. So I then tried<br /></span><pre> def exists(s: Set, p: Int =&gt; Boolean): Boolean = !(!forall(s, p))<code></code></pre>which is also wrong. It would be easy to solve with a recursive loop similar to ""forall"", but I can't see how to use the ""forall"" function to solve it in one line.<br /><br />With the map problem, there are two issues:<br />1. What is the difference between having a function with a set type, which returns a boolean, versus a function with a boolean type, which returns a boolean? I don't really understand the distinction here<br />2. I could solve it easily with a pattern like the ""forall"" function, using recursion, but how can I solve it one line? Do I use a for loop, or do I set up a range variable, or perhaps there is a means of factoring the ""forall"" function with an anonymous function that makes it all go to one line. I don't understand.<br /><br />Finally, I submitted some code (without implementing ""map"", with ""exists"" incorrect and no tests implemented), but couldn't understand the feedback (Code <span>8c108081-8fa9-4ae7-b799-b539ee3f76a4). One thing that I noted was that my Filter function was wrong.<br /></span><br />My filter function was the same as my intersect function, where<br /><pre><code> def intersect(s: Set, t: Set): Set = (x: Int) =&gt; s(x) &amp;&amp; t(x)
def filter(s: Set, p: Int =&gt; Boolean): Set = (x: Int) =&gt; s(x) &amp;&amp; p(x)
</code></pre>It came out wrong, but I don't understand why. Somehow there must be some subtlety I am missing between the type definition for t and p, that makes one work and not the other. But if the definition for the type Set is equal to Int =&gt;Boolean, which is the same as p, then why are they different?? I don't understand the distinction here.<br /><br />finally, I have taken this course during my Chem Eng PhD (as a mature age student), since I was going to use Scala to do some programming to solve some problems in my thesis, but I have spent days and days trying to understand this single assignment, and didn't even get to finishing the tests.<br /><br />should I give up, since this is taking way more than the supposed seven hours per week???? Perhaps as a mature age student, I lack the background and should just stick to imperative tools for solving engineering problems? <br /><br />Note, I learnt programming in fortran on punch cards, taught myself C (From Kerningham and Ritchie) and programmed a simulator on a Windowing system, before Microsoft Windows was released. I then spent twenty years in IT, before going back to engineering, and taught myself Delphi, Visual Basic and C++, as well as engineering tools (Scheme for Ansys, Matlab and Mathematica). Given this self-taught background, perhaps either Scala is too hard, or the material does not suit my background.

Your response has been excellent in clearing up where the issue lies, so thanks enormously. Thank god, my understanding of the types is correct, and that intersect and filter are correct, thank you for the clarification.<br /><br />Further, I have understood the iterative approach used in the ""forall"" method, but clearly I have not properly grasped the anonymous function approach, since this lies at the heart of the solution for both the ""exists"" and the ""map"" methods. i have some further questions on your feedback and wonder if you could elaborate.<br /><br />Questions:<br />1. You have a strategy to create the negation of the function p, and knew that it couldn't be done on the function, which I understand as I got that far. So your approach is to create the predicate as an anonymous function (x:Int)=&gt;!p(x), but I'm not sure I understand this properly. I see two possibilities, one where I apply the x:Int to both sets, or one where I apply it only to the function p, so either<br /><pre><code>def exists(s: Set, p: Int =&gt; Boolean): Boolean = ((x:Int)=&gt; forall(s(x), !p(x))

def exists(s: Set, p: Int =&gt; Boolean): Boolean = forall(s, (x:Int)=&gt;!p(x))
</code></pre>If it is the second option, then why is an x:Int needed for the second argument, but not the first? I don't understand how the anonymous function works compared to the other function without an integer in it. Can I put the anonymous function anywhere? Is it self-contained? Could I use a different anonymous function for each of the arguments, if for some reason i wanted to (i.e. each with an x:Int)?<br /><br />2. With regard to the map function, I would have thought I have to go through each integer in the set between the bounds, and thereby an iterative approach seems obvious. Professor Odersky mentions that anonymous functions are syntactic sugar, so could I make the ""iter"" function from the ""forall"" function into one? Or alternatively is it possible to use a for loop, or a range variable and somehow step through each of the integers between the bounds using an anonymous function? Why would this iterative approach be wrong (I feel it is, I just don't know why)? Should i try to simplify everything into anonymous functions? When do I use them?<br /><br />3. Your actual suggestion for the map function, using exists and a non-obvious anonymous functions seems really confusing to me. Instinctively, maybe imperatively (?), it seems an obvious strategy to use a loop, which goes through each integer and multiplies it by the function and adds it into the new set. But this seems wrong, like not functional. Is this just really simple somehow, and I'm not seeing it? Is it just multiplying s(x) * f, for every x? So, maybe<br /><pre><code>def map(s: Set, f: Int =&gt; Int): Set = (x:Int) =&gt; f(s(x))</code></pre>but once again this looks wrong, as I don't think I'm understanding the types properly. Frankly, i think I'm just parroting patterns, and don't have a proper grasp of what to do. Its easy to understand what to do imperatively (i.e. loop and multiply each value), but I'm not understanding the strategy for this functional programming.<br /> <br />I look forward to your responses and hope that you can open my eyes properly.<br /><br />Thanks<br /> ",NA,NA,NA

This is what Odersky taught in the lectures. Looks correct, right? I just disliked it from very beginning because of poor efficiency. You see that acc grows with every item we include. You add right to acc. This means that large acc must be decomposed (and composed again) for every left item you add then. Once node is decomposed into left and right, you recompose the tree and so on, for every subitem.

In the best implementation, <br /><pre><code>if (p(elem)) acc1.incl(elem) else acc1</code></pre><br />in the union-filterAcc recursion should be called no more than 7 times. And, you see, this happens in case of<br /><br /><pre><code>  val acc1 = right.union(left.union(acc)) // 7</code><br /></pre>and<br /><br /><pre><code><code>  </code>val acc1 = left.union(right.union(acc)) // 7</code></pre><br />implementations. In both cases we supply acc only as argument to the union, which means that it is never decomposed. My guess was right. <br /><br />The worst implementation was <br /><br /><pre><code>acc.union(right).union(left)</code></pre><br />with almost 400 recursive iterations. It is because acc is always decomposed. Furthermore, once acc is decomposed, we start decomposing the right, because it becomes the argument. Once they are decomposed/recomposed into to new acc, the process is repeated with acc.unite(left). This implementation won't pass the performance test!<br /><br />",NA,NA,NA

I suggest you try the code you suggest in an IDE to see the type errors.<br />The first alternative you gave does not typeckeck at all: You want to return a boolean, but you return a function (Int =&gt; Boolean). So it's definitely wrong. <br />When defining exists, look at the type of forall: Its first argument is a set. You want the exists to apply on exaclty the same set s, so why try to change it at all? You don't need to define a new one, just pass the same! Whereas the predicate you pass to forall is not at all the same: think of the formal definition I gave above. You have to construct a new one, that's why you need the anonymous function. You cannot apply ! directly on a value of type (Int =&gt; Boolean), of course.<br />2) Of course you can do iteration. One of the advantages of functional programming though, is that you don't need to: Higher-order functions are so powerful that by synthesizing them you can express many things without explicit iteration. So your long loops from Java or C++ become one-liners. So the best solution would be to reuse some of the functions you define already.<br />As to when you use anonymous functions, it is whenever you need to construct a function on the fly; there is no specific rules.<br />3) Can you express (in words!) what map should do, in terms of exists? As in: ""map(s, f) is the set of all elements x, for which ...""<br />After you do this, just translate it directly into code and you are good to go!

When I learned functional programming I found it to be very helpful to spell things out explicitly (for years).<br /><br />So for exists, we can name a useful function:<br /><br /><pre><code>def exists(s: Set, p: Int =&gt; Boolean): Boolean = {
  def notP(x: Int): Boolean = !p(x) // I just defined a new function which is true when p(x) fails
  !forall(s, notP) // an element of s satisfies p if not all elements fail p
}</code></pre><br />map() is a bit harder, and to be honest it expresses a fairly deep concept for this stage in the course.<br /><br />I think the best way to start is to remember that a Set is actually a function from Ints to Booleans. That is, a Set is a thing which can say whether or not a given Int is in it. map(s, f) returns a Set, so it needs to be able to say ""true"" or ""false"" when asked whether some Int ""y"" is in it.<br /><br />Per the instructions, the set map(s, f) is a new set containing any Int that is the result of calling f() on an Int that is  in s. In other words, if an Int y is in map(s, f), then s must contain some Int (call it x) such that f(x) = y. We can express this in terms of exists, with no anonymous functions:<br /><br /><pre><code>def map(s: Set, f: Int =&gt; Int): Set = {
  def someXinSMapsToY(y: Int): Boolean = {
    def thisXMapsToY(x: Int): Boolean = 
      f(x) == y
    exists(s, thisXMapsToY)
  }
  someXinSMapsToY
}</code></pre><br />This is a bit complicated, but we can see what's happening piecewise. I think it's easiest to start in the middle. thisXMapsToY(x) is true whenever f(x) == y, which is straightforward. We use it as the test in exists() to find out whether or not any element of s maps to y. The final return value is this function (someXinSMapsToY) which returns ""true"" when called on ""y"" that passes this exists() test.<br /><br />In case it is helpful to see the anonymous version of map:<br /><br /><pre><code>def map2(s: Set, f: Int =&gt; Int): Set = 
    (y: Int) =&gt; exists(s, (x: Int) =&gt; f(x) == y)<br /></code></pre>""(x: Int) =&gt; f(x) == y"" is equivalent to thisXMapsToY, and the entire second line is equivalent to someXinSMapsToY.<br /><br />I hope I haven't made things worse.<br /><br />",NA,NA,NA

<p><strong>Method B</strong>: Sorting only the last element in case the list contains an odd number of elements; by relying on the fact that the list are originally inserted in ascending order. If the number of elements are even, then we do not need to perform sorting at all.</p>
<p>The list are guaranteed to be in ascending order by its <code>weight</code>. Consider for our example a list <strong>L</strong> containing 5 elements <code>List(a, b, c, d, e)</code>, where the condition <code>a &lt; b &lt; c &lt; d &lt; e</code> holds. </p>
<p>Based on that property, it is then guaranteed that when we combine every two elements in <strong>L</strong>, the order will still hold e.g. <code>a + b &lt; c + d</code>. However, we will need to reinsert <code>e</code> at the correct place e.g. by using <code>sortWith</code>. This condition applies to every list which contains an odd number of elements.</p>
<p><strong>My question</strong>:</p>
<p>Do we really need to perform sorting here? If we really do then I feel like sorting the initial input (i.e. using <code>makeOrderedLeafList</code>) would not be of much use. Why would we need to sort it in the first place if we are going to sort it again due to inserting new elements?</p>

The solution is to utilize that pattern matching is customizable in Scala. So what you can do is define your ""flat"" class hierarchy (just Expr and case classes inheriting directly from it) and then add additional, customized ""pattern-matchers"" to do what you want. The way to do it is to define the unapply method in the respecive object. E.g.<br /><br /><pre><code>object AddSub {
  def unapply(e : Expr) : Option[Expr] = e match {
    case s : Sub =&gt; Some(s)
    case a : Add =&gt; Some(a)
    case _ =&gt; None
  }
}</code></pre>The idea is that the unapply function returns a Some in the cases you want the pattern matching to succeed, and the content of this some is the subpatterns you retrieve from the pattern matching. If pattern matching should fail, you return None. So now you can write<br /><br /><pre><code>this match {
  case Prod(AddSub(l), AddSub(r)) =&gt; s""($l)*($r)""
  ...
}</code></pre><br />(btw, this is called string interpolation and you should use it instead of String.format in Scala).<br /><br />This is quite advanced Scala material, but I hope it will motivate you to look further into it! <br /><br />",NA,NA,NA

It is authored by <a href=""https://www.coursera.org/user/i/73da71947b45602d8810d2f586f4e35c"">Pavel Lepin</a></p><p><b>Do I need to watch week 5 / week 6 lectures for this assignment?</b></p>
<p>Yes. The assignment covers all of the material up to and including week 6.</p>
<p><b>Should I avoid recursion, explicit or implicit, in my solutions for this assignment?</b></p>
<p>The answer is definitely no for implicit, and not necessarily for 
explicit. Many of the functions we have to implement can be made more 
elegant through the use of <code>for</code>-expressions and/or HOFs. But
 if you feel a straightforward explicitly recursive solution makes more 
sense, go ahead and give it a shot.</p>
<p><b>May I use mutable variables in this assignment? It seems natural in some parts of it.</b></p>
<p>No. The same policy holds as with the rest of the course. Grader will
 dock points for the use of mutable variables. Anything that can be 
implemented with mutable variables, can also be implemented without 
them, and usually without much, if any, overhead in terms of source code
 readability.</p>
<p><b>My <code>for</code>-expressions do not compile due to cryptic type errors.</b></p>
<p>First of all, the sequence type of the first generator expression determines the sequence type for the entire <code>for</code>-expression - it's easy to run afoul of this.</p>
<p>Secondly, if you're still stuck, consider desugaring your <code>for</code>-expression following Prof. Odersky's explanations in the lectures, and rewriting it as a series of <code>val</code>s
 (perhaps even giving those explicit types to help you figure out where 
does the problem lie). This should help you figure out in which part of 
your expression the type mismatch actually is. (This may take a while, 
but it's very useful to go through this process at least once.) When 
you're working with nested lists, the most likely cause is that you've 
missed one level of nesting somewhere, or vice versa, introduced an 
unnecessary level of nesting. If you're using multiple containers you 
may need to use <code>toList</code> or such to make your types agree.</p>
<p>Lastly, one relatively common problem is figuring out how does the parser treat the expression after the <code>yield</code>. Something like <code>for { ... } yield x :: xs</code> means <code>(for { ... } yield x) :: xs</code>, while you probably wanted to say <code>for { ... } yield (x :: xs)</code>.</p>
<p><b>What should I do about words containing characters not in the alphabet specified by the assignment handout?</b></p>
<p>The alphabet is not exhaustive, unfortunately. The good news is, you 
don't really need to know the alphabet at all to solve the assignment. 
If you just assume any characters may appear in the input, you solution 
will be fine with the grader.</p>
<p><b>Is the list of occurrences supposed to be in some specific order?</b></p>
<p>Yes. The <code>Occurrences</code> type comes with an implied 
invariant of always being sorted by the character. Your solutions may 
rely on the fact that all inputs provided to them fulfill said 
invariant, and must in turn ensure that all outputs returned by them do 
so as well. This is explicitly mentioned both in the assignment handout 
and in the source code comments.</p>
<p><b>Does <code>wordOccurrences</code> have to make use of <code>groupBy</code>?</b></p>
<p>Yes. The use of <code>groupBy</code> here is required by the grader.</p>
<p><b>Is there an easy way to make a <code>Word</code> out of a <code>Sentence</code>?</b></p>
<p>Yes. Look up <code>mkString</code> in the documentation.</p>
<p><b>My <code>dictionaryByOccurences</code> breaks on words not in the dictionary. How do I fix it?</b></p>
<p>Using <code>withDefaultValue</code> - this was shown in the lectures discussing the <code>Map[T, V]</code> containers.</p>
<p><b>I'm totally lost on <code>combinations</code>. How do I do it?</b></p>
<p>One way (not necessarily the best one) to approach this problem would be to think about properties of <code>combinations</code>
 inductively. What are the combinations of an empty set? Given the list 
of combinations for some set A, how do you obtain a list of combinations
 for a set A with an extra element X included in it?</p>
<p><b>May my implementation of <code>subtract</code> assume that it's not going to be provided an y that is not a subset of x?</b></p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><b>Do I have to use the suggested functions for my implementation of <code>subtract</code>?</b></p>
<p>No. Doing so will be quite instructive, but the grader won't check for implementation details here, as long as your <code>subtract</code> implements the behavioural requirements.</p>
<p><b>What is the list of anagrams of an empty sentence?</b></p>
<p>It's a list consisting of empty sentence itself. (That is, an empty list.)</p>
<p><b>How do I filter out ""incomplete"" anagrams?</b></p>
<p>One way to ensure that would be to implement previous parts of the 
assignment in such a way that the list of anagrams for a word not in the
 dictionary would be empty.</p>
<p><b>Dictionary file seems to be missing some words I assumed would be there.</b></p>
<p>Yeah. Do not assume a common word will be in it. When in doubt, check it.</p>
<p><b>How about mutability in the challenge assignment?</b></p>
<p>You should not submit this part of your code, especially if you do 
this with mutable containers. Note that while doing this with mutable 
containers is the most straightforward way to do this, it's not strictly
 necessary, as Scala already has the fundamental ""caching"" mechanism 
implemented in form of <code>lazy val</code>s. Given those, we can do 
the rest without mutable data structures. Also note that in pure world 
lazy evaluation strategy is equivalent to call-by-name to the factor of 
computational complexity - that is, it's an optimization that preserves 
expression semantics.</p>",NA,NA,NA

Maintainability (2): immutable objects that never contain nulls describe what you can expect. This is a huge improvement over the Java Beans object pattern.<br />4.

Lists are not optimized for random access, and should probably not be used in an application if that's going to change your asymptotic runtime for the worse.<br /><br />In a first-year Java class, one might learn how to compute the sum of an array of ints. However, in practice, if you were writing an application where you repeatedly modified an array of ints and recomputed its sum, you would switch to a data structure that retains a running sum and updates this sum whenever the array is modified. The fact that a simple array isn't the most efficient solution in every application doesn't make it a poor teaching tool.<br /><br />I agree with you, though, that making copies of large data structures is a bad idea. I have cringed more than a few times when learning FP at how much more space-efficient a simple solution with mutable data structures can be.

many times and it gave <br />&gt; the same result each time, so it's an 
implementation problem and not a JIT issue.<br /><br />In the JVM, methods may have to be called hundreds or thousands of times before they are compiled as opposed to interpreted.  (I don't know enough about the CLR to compare.)  Doing something a dozen times is not enough to cause it to be compiled, so in that case you're running interpreted code, not native code.  This is a problem with microbenchmarks.  See, for example, <a title=""Link: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/504103/how-do-i-write-a-correct-micro-benchmark-in-java"" href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/504103/how-do-i-write-a-correct-micro-benchmark-in-java"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/504103/how-do-i-write-a-correct-micro-benchmark-in-java</a><br /><br />&gt; If we have to use different classes depending on which order we intend 
to traverse a collection<br />&gt; of data (which might be determined at runtime) 
then scala isn't delivering the promise of allowing<br />&gt; us to write what we 
want, rather than writing how to do what we want.<br /><br />I disagree.  In any language, you have to think about how your data structure will be used and choose accordingly.  This is why Java offers ArrayList, LinkedList, Deque, and other list and list-like options.  If you need random access to a long list, don't use a linked list.<br /><br />One disadvantage of an immutable linked list is that accessing or changing a single element at the end is expensive in terms of memory and CPU.  If you're doing that a lot, you wouldn't use an immutable linked list, just as you didn't in C#.  There's nothing in Scala stopping you from using the Java standard library collections or Scala mutable collections if they are a better fit for what you are doing.  But once you start using them in a multi-threaded fashion, you're back to using locks or synchronization.<br /><br />I think the point of the recursive algorithms is that they're trying to teach the different way of thinking.  This doesn't mean that everything you do in functional programming has to be recursive (or tail-recursive).  But the only way to learn to think that way is to do it, over and over, until it starts to feel normal.<br /><br />",NA,NA,NA

<p>so you should invoke it without the parentheses. For scala calling scala, you typically want to invoke a method the way it's defined.

I need to learn Scala methods if I want to use Scala effectively.<br />2. To follow and absorb the lectures and do these assignments there is already PLENTY to do and think about and struggle over (for me, anyway). If I can properly use a library function, I feel a gain in knowledge, no loss, and no feeling of missed opportunity. (And it makes it more likely I can submit in a timely manner! As well as to get back and take in all that is done in the lectures.)<br />3. If used as intended, library functions are going to be optimized better than anything I would write; and likely implemented in ways entirely different than I would do.<br />4. Surely it is sound FP thinking to be appropriately exploiting the available higher-order functions, such as map, which is what I happened to use in my ""times"" function.<br />5. Working with standard built-ins seems to advance my ability to use the language more than putting together equivalent code from primitive elements. For example, foldLeft is well suited for the ""encode"" function: the (worthwhile) work one must then do is find precisely an appropriate function of type (List[Bit], Char) =&gt; List[Bit] to put into the foldLeft. <br />6. For my submissions, the use of map, foldLeft, sortBy did not elicit any complaints from the grader.<br /><br />From my perspective, proper use of established technology is a good thing, and aids learning, even for a novice; in fact, it is what I want to learn. Reinventing wheels, not so much. When you really need to build a wheel for the learning benefit it brings—this is usually pretty clear, and occurs often enough in this course's lecture examples and questions—just dig in.<br /><br /><br />",NA,NA,NA

<p><em>Map[] based solution actually WOULD be more efficient </em></p>
<p>For encoding - yes. Once this map is built - it would be faster to encode a string into bits.</p>

<p>Regarding your question about <code>from</code>: the idea is that it generates a stream of paths, where (depending on what the initial stream contains) the first element is the empty path, the next few elements are all the possible paths of length 1 that can be reached from the starting position, the next elements after that are all the possible paths of length 2 that can be reached from the starting position, et cetera.</p>
<p>Once you have that stream, your Bloxorz solver can just walk through the stream until you find a path that leads to the goal. Because the paths in the stream are ordered by length, the first solution you find is also the shortest.</p>

But the last one is really great.<br /><br />In a retrospective, I had a lot of fun doing this course. However, there is a thing or two you might want to consider:<br /><br />What did I considered as remarkably good and helped me a lot?<br /><br />- Blending the video of your desk over the slides. While it does not appear to be that important it makes following your explanations much easier if one can follow your actual workflow. In most other courses here on Coursera slide-annotations just pop up all over the place, requiring me to pause and seek back and forth to check what actually just changed and why. Do you use a special software / equipment to achieve this?<br /><br />- Assignments where one has to accomplish a larger task that is broken into several parts.<br /><br />- The output of your assignment checking tool is great. Apparently, I often tend to forget checking special conditions like ""Nil""-inputs. ;-)<br /><br /><br />What was not so good?<br /><br />- The audio of some videos is very noisy. Through my laptop's speakers it was sometimes almost impossible to understand you. Playing around with the equalizer of VLC helped a little bit. (Hence, maybe you could try to denoise it?)<br /><br />- I was unable to import your projects into IntelliJ (which I normally use for writing Code). The example steps from the video did not work. However, I did not bother because downloading ScalaIDE (which I, after doing the assignments in this environment, consider as totally buggy) was the easier solution.<br />Platform: IntelliJ 13, Oracle Java 8, LinuxMint 17<br /><br />- The signature track instructions should be revised (see my other post)<br /><a href=""https://class.coursera.org/progfun-005/forum/thread?thread_id=667"">https://class.coursera.org/progfun-005/forum/thread?thread_id=667</a><br /><br /><br />Anyway, this course has helped me to understand the potential of Scala. I have begun working on a larger project in Scala and what I have learned here allowed me leave the OO-Mindset, that I have acquired throughout the past 15 years, behind. I will definitely design some functions different (i.e. more functional) because of the things I learned in this course.<br /><br />~tel<br />",NA,NA,NA

It is authored by <a href=""https://www.coursera.org/user/i/73da71947b45602d8810d2f586f4e35c"">Pavel Lepin</a></p><p><b>Any ideas on testing my solutions?</b></p>
<p>You could try using a few levels from the original flash game and see whether your algo manages to find a correct solution.</p>
<p><b>Which one is <code>x</code>, and which one is <code>y</code> as far as <code>Pos</code> is concerned?</b></p>
<p>If you're accesing a vector of vectors representing the terrain, you should index by <code>x</code> first, and by <code>y</code> second.</p>
<p><b>What do the two positions supplied to <code>Block</code> constructor represent?</b></p>
<p>The positions of two blocks comprising the playing piece. If the 
playing piece is standing upright, both are the same, otherwise the two 
positions are adjacent.</p>
<p><b>May I assume coordinates supplied to <code>terrainFunction</code> will not be out-of-bounds?</b></p>
<p>No. You should explicitly check for coordinates being within bounds. Both ways.</p>
<p><b>What does <code>terrainFunction</code> really mean?</b></p>
<p>Whether you can place a block (vertically) without ending the game at given coordinates.</p>
<p><b>Is <code>neighborsWithHistory</code> supposed to produce an infinite stream of positions?</b></p>
<p>No, don't overthink it. You only need to generate immediate 
neighbors. The rest will be handled by functions implemented later in 
the assignment.</p>
<p><b>How is my <code>from</code> supposed to handle infinite terrain?</b></p>
<p>Naturally. The tail of a stream will not be evaluated unless needed. Since <code>solution</code> only takes the first path to goal, the entire infinite solution space will not be explored (as long as there's <i>some</i> solution in it). There's an important caveat here: the behavior of <code>++</code> is unintuitive, as it will, in fact, force partial evaluation of its second operand. Just use <code>#:::</code> instead, which is the equivalent of <code>++</code>, but behaves sensibly for lazy streams, never touching its second operand.</p>
<p><b>Running <code>Bloxxorz</code> causes stack overflow.</b></p>
<p>See the answer to the previous question.</p>
<p><b>Can't we just determine <code>explored</code> from <code>initial</code> in <code>from</code>?</b></p>
<p><code>initial</code> may represent a partially explored space, so no.</p>
<p><b>I'm having a hard time debugging and/or dealing with type errors in from.</b></p>
<p>Try decomposing your logic through the use of <code>val</code>s, perhaps giving your expessions explicit types.</p>
<p><b>My solution blows up when graded - what should solution return when no solution is possible?</b></p>
<p>An empty <code>List</code>, as the comments suggest.</p>
<p>Lastly, just hang on in there. You're very close to completing this 
class, which is no small feat, and if you worked through the lectures 
and previous assignments, you should be up to this last climb.</p><br /><br />",NA,NA,NA

I feel it should be a function call passing () =&gt; Unit (i.e. the function of type Action) through afterDelay() into WorkItem, using the call by name format to prevent execution.

Your overall score for this assignment is 0.00 out of 10.00

We were not able to compile our tests, and therefore we could not correct your submission.

The most likely reason for this problem is that your submitted code uses different names
for methods, classes, objects or different types than expected.

In principle, this can only arise if you changed some names or types in the code that we
provide, for instance a method name or a parameter type.

To diagnose your problem, perform the following steps:
 - Run the tests that we provide with our hand-out. These tests verify that all names and
   types are correct. In case these tests pass, but you still see this message, please post
   a report on the forums [1].
 - Take a careful look at the error messages from the Scala compiler below. They should give
   you a hint where your code has an unexpected shape.

If you cannot find a solution, ask for help on the discussion forums on the course website.

We were not able to compile our tests, and therefore we could not correct your submission.

The most likely reason for this problem is that your submitted code uses different names
for methods, classes, objects or different types than expected.

In principle, this can only arise if you changed some names or types in the code that we
provide, for instance a method name or a parameter type.

To diagnose your problem, perform the following steps:
 - Run the tests that we provide with our hand-out. These tests verify that all names and
   types are correct. In case these tests pass, but you still see this message, please post
   a report on the forums [1].
 - Take a careful look at the error messages from the Scala compiler below. They should give
   you a hint where your code has an unexpected shape.

If you cannot find a solution, ask for help on the discussion forums on the course website.

The code you submitted did not pass all of our tests: your submission achieved a score of

In order to find bugs in your code, we advise to perform the following steps:
 - Take a close look at the test output that you can find below: it should point you to
   the part of your code that has bugs.
 - Run the tests that we provide with the handout on your code.
 - The tests we provide do not test your code in depth: they are very incomplete. In order
   to test more aspects of your code, write your own unit tests.
 - Take another very careful look at the assignment description. Try to find out if you
   misunderstood parts of it. While reading through the assignment, write more tests.

Below you can find a short feedback for every individual test that failed.

Our automated style checker tool could not find any issues with your code. You obtained the maximal
style score of 4.00.

======== LOG OF FAILED TESTS ========

Your solution achieved a testing score of 70 out of 75.
Below you can see a short feedback for every test that failed, indicating the reason
for the test failure and how many points you lost for each individual test.

<pre><code>Vector(level.split(""\n"").map(str =&gt; Vector(str: _*)): _*)</code></pre>
<p>The <code>_*</code> is a compiler hint to treat a single sequence parameter as multiple decomposed parameters to a varargs function. A <code>String</code> f.e. is treated by the compiler as a sequence of <code>Char</code> objects. And an <code>Array[Vector[Char]]</code> is treated as a sequence of <code>Vector[Char]</code> objects. This makes a big difference to the called Vector.apply() method.</p>
<p>Taken from the <a href=""http://docs.scala-lang.org/style/types.html"">Scala Documentation</a>:</p>
<h2>Ascriptions</h2>
<p>Type ascription is often confused with type annotation, as the syntax in Scala is identical. The following are examples of ascription:</p>
<ul><li><code>Nil: List[String]</code></li>
<li><code>Set(values: _*)</code></li>
<li><code>""Daniel"": AnyRef</code></li>
</ul><p>Ascription is basically just an up-cast performed at compile-time for the sake of the type checker. Its use is not common, but it does happen on occasion. The most often seen case of ascription is invoking a varargs method with a single <code>Seq</code> parameter. This is done by ascribing the <code>_*</code> type (as in the second example above).</p>

It's kinda awkward verification where you need to take a photo of your face before each homework submit. You must also provide o webcam photo of your ID when you register for <em>Signature Track</em>. Coursera claims that <em>Your photo identification document will be deleted after successful verification of your profile information.</em> But they still may keep (and improve further each time) your biometric information that is used for photo verification. Coursera saves and verifies also your typing pattern. On the other hand as an U.S. company they are obligated to provide any stored information to the government. In the worst case the NSA can track you down by this data on other websites or even on airports, rail stations and street surveillance cameras.</p>
<p>If you still want a verified certificate from Coursera, add a future session of this course to your watch list. Maybe in 1-2 month a new session will start and you can then submit your assignments again with a paid <em>Signature Track</em>. AFAIK they don't change the assignments on new sessions.</p>

<pre><code class=""lang-scala"">test(""sentence anagrams: []"") {
  val sentence = List()
  assert(sentenceAnagrams(sentence) === List(Nil))
}</code></pre>
<p>Why anagrams of an empty sentence is a <code>List(Nil)</code> and not just <code>List()</code>?</p>
<p>A good hint which could have saved me (and probably others) a lot of time would be a reminder that:</p>
<pre><code>  def computeList(a: Int):List[Int] = List()
  for {
    a &lt;- List(1, 2, 3)
    b &lt;- computeList(a)
  } yield
     (a, b)</code></pre>
<p>Will not yield anything, because inner loop is over the empty list (which totally makes sense).</p>
<p>Another confusing (unexpected) part was that I tried to use Nil as a different return code from List():</p>
<pre><code>  def computeListOfLists(a: Int):List[List[Int]] = a match {
    case 1 =&gt; List(List(888))
    case 2 =&gt; List() // blank solution
    case 3 =&gt; Nil // no solution
  }
  for {
    a &lt;- List(1, 2, 3)
    b &lt;- computeListOfLists(a)
    if b != Nil
  } yield
     a :: b</code></pre>
<p>Yields <code>List(List(1, 888))</code> and not <code>List(List(1, 888), List(2))</code>.</p>
<p>The real reason is that b cannot be iterated on an empty list. Why <code>Nil == List()</code>? In the end I realized that this works:</p>
<pre><code>  def computeListOfLists(a: Int):List[List[Int]] = a match {
    case 1 =&gt; List(List(888))
    case 2 =&gt; List(Nil) // same as List(List())
    case 3 =&gt; Nil
  }
  for {
    a &lt;- List(1, 2, 3)
    b &lt;- computeListOfLists(a)
  } yield
     a :: b</code></pre>
<p>Yields <code>List(List(1, 888), List(2))</code> as expected.</p>
<p>Would you please consider adding a hint / reminder about this in the assignment description for future students?</p>

<p>I wrote 2 versions using group by:</p>
<ol><li>One involved reversing the map produced by <code>groupBy</code> which resulted in 2 nested loops (similar to the example shown in the Lecture 6.7 video about the phone numbers).</li>
<li>Another was using groupBy + map combination similar to the example in assignment description. However that seems weird because it produces intermediate result which is getting transformed &amp; discarded:<pre><code>Map(

1 -&gt; List(1, 1),

</ol><p>Both of these seem clumsy. My original solution used just a single map (one could argue there is another hidden inside of <code>distinct</code> or <code>toSet</code> depending what I use).</p>

a concrete example of a problem.  Anyway, I enjoyed it <span>so much that I decided to do the ‘obvious’ thing and extend it to incorporate
the more advanced rules of Bloxorz, i.e. squares representing:</span></span></p>

<ul><li>fragile terrain on which you cannot have a standing block</li><li>teleports that split the block into two single blocks, and you use toggle between them (until they come back together)</li><li>switches to create/destroy/toggle bridges</li><li><span>switches that need a ‘heavy’ standing block on them to
operate them.</span></li></ul><p><span>If anyone is interested in this, and wants some pointers (without giving everything
away, and certainly without helping you with the basic assignment!) here are a
few notes on how I did it.  If you are interested, but want
to do it all yourself, then look away now!</span></p>

<ul><li><span>Solving.  I thought
about this first, because it influences the other changes.  The main change is that when calculating paths, not only do you have to pass around a list of tuples of (block, list of moves that got you to that block), you also have to pass around the updated terrain at that point (since the terrain can now change).  I introduced a new Terrain class (see below), and then the solving generates passes around Stream[(Block, List[Move], Terrain)].  <span>Also explored is now Set[(Block, Terrain)] (e.g. two explored ‘positions’ are different if they have the same Block, but different Terrains). </span></span></li><li><span><span>‘Block’ class.</span>  Still defined as b1 and b2 positions.  <span>But if a ‘Block’ is split then the positions needn’t be adjacent (or on top of each other).</span>  I decided b1 would represent the active half of a split block (which means relaxing the requirement that b1 is lexicographically less than b2).  Various updates to up/down/left/right.  <span>A new ‘toggle’ returning the toggling of split block (swap over b1 and b2).</span>  <span>If the block is split then ‘neighbours’ also returns a move of toggling the block.</span>  <span>‘isLegal’ needs to take into account fragile terrain (see below).</span>  </span></li><li><span><span>‘Terrain’ class.  </span>Previously the terrain was just a function of type Pos =&gt; Boolean, whether a position was in the terrain or not.  I first defined a new Square class to represent the squares of the terrain, with case sub-classes In, Out, Start, Goal, Fragile, Split, HeavySwitch, SoftSwitch.  The last three case classes were parameterized with the new positions resulting from a split, or a List(Pos) to represent a bridge and whether the switch created, destroyed or toggled it.  The base terrain is then a function of type Pos =&gt; Square.  <span>I defined a new ‘Terrain’ class to represent the dynamically changing terrain.</span>  Objects of this class can be passed around when solving the problem (as mentioned above).  I implemented the class with a Map[Pos, Boolean] which is a representation of the positions that have been overridden from the base terrain to be in or out.  Various methods on this class.  inTerrain: Pos =&gt; Boolean looks to see if there is an override in the map, else looks at the base terrain.  update: (Pos, Boolean) =&gt; Terrain adds or updates an overridden position in the map with whether it is in or out.  updateBridge update all the list of positions for a given bridge when its switch is hit.  <span>Finally ‘move’ moves a block on this terrain, which inspects the postion(s) it has moved to, and returns a possibly new block (e.g. it might have been split), and a possibly new terrain (e.g. bridges changed).</span></span></li><li><span><span>When implementing ‘move’ you discover some complexities if non-standing blocks cover two special squares.  </span>Some can be handled, but some lead to ill-defined behaviour.  E.g. a block could activate two switches, so you need to apply the updates to the terrain for one then the other, but if both switches act on the same bridge the order you apply the updates in could make a difference to the resulting terrain.  Or what do you do if a block spans two teleports?  <span>I just assumed levels wouldn’t be defined like that.</span></span></li><li><span>Parsing.  Change terrainFunction to return a function of type Pos =&gt; Square.  <span>You can incorporate a new symbol in the text representation of a level for ‘fragile’ squares.</span>  But I separately defined any other special squares as val specials: Map[Pos, Square].  </span></li></ul><p>For example, here is a level with a switch that toggles a bridge

We were not able to compile our tests, and therefore we could not correct your submission.

The most likely reason for this problem is that your submitted code uses different names
for methods, classes, objects or different types than expected.

In principle, this can only arise if you changed some names or types in the code that we
provide, for instance a method name or a parameter type.

To diagnose your problem, perform the following steps:
 - Run the tests that we provide with our hand-out. These tests verify that all names and
   types are correct. In case these tests pass, but you still see this message, please post
   a report on the forums [1].
 - Take a careful look at the error messages from the Scala compiler below. They should give
   you a hint where your code has an unexpected shape.

If you cannot find a solution, ask for help on the discussion forums on the course website.

The key thing to recognize is that the foldLeft that is being used is not the one that is defined for Map (because, you are right, that is of the wrong type). But, if you look in the API docs, Map extends Iterable which defines thus version of foldLeft:<br /><pre><code>foldLeft[B](z: B)(op: (B, A) =&gt; B): B</code></pre>So now we can do this (based on the previous example):<br /><pre><code>type A1 = (Int,Double)
type B1 = Map[Int,Double]
def t1:B1 = terms1
def t2:B1 = terms2
t1.foldLeft(t2)(addTerm)
</code></pre><div><br /></div>Notice that the signature for addTerms can also be written as<br /><pre><code>addTerm(terms:B1,A1): B1</code></pre><br />So no why does this work? It is because the foldLeft for Iterable is defined to apply the operation to the elements of the receiver object (the Map[Int,Double] t1 in the example). And what are the elements of that Map? The (key,value) tuples. And indeed, foldLeft for Iterable is defined using the forEach method of the receiver Map which does indeed have the signature<br /><pre><code>forEach(f: ((A,B)) =&gt; Unit): Unit</code></pre>",NA,NA,NA

There is no efficiency gain. Actually if the function is tail recursive then the compiler will emit a simple loop byte code. Many people seem to have this assumption that, yes, functional programing is indeed elegant, powerful and beautiful, but imperative programing is just more efficient. It's just a rumor.</p>

I made an assumption that I would be capable of doing the exercises only with the material I learnt from the course but that was impossible, I did some research from stackoverflow for reach solution for many exercises excluding the Pascal Triangle due fact I had the Newtons formula in my brain since high school, but I had to make that critics about the exercises, its fair beyond the knowledge of me only with course material.<br /><br />Edit:<br /><br />After some thinking about it, I could made a suggestion for enrich exercises next time adding more details. I don't know about the coins problem had some deep mathematics background, we try to solve those exercises by directly programming but this approach isn't eficient and lead to frustration. The exercises doesn't have enough information about concepts involved, for suggestion try add more formulas and a little more concepts on how to achieve the solution. We can't have all those concepts in our memory without having a lot of academic form education, most of us doesn't have a Masters degree or a PHD.<br /><br />Best regards.","Question",5,3

algorithms and discrete maths is required and some algorithms are 
challenging to find for those who left academia long ago. Algorithms 
should not be the point of this course""<br /><br />Is it what you are saying ? If so, I understand, and think it is a valid stand point. but let me give you mine:<br /><br />First most solutions can be found in companion books:<br /><a title=""Link: https://class.coursera.org/progfun-005/wiki/LearningResources"" href=""https://class.coursera.org/progfun-005/wiki/LearningResources"">https://class.coursera.org/progfun-005/wiki/LearningResources</a><br /><br />I hate looking for solutions or even hints in books, I'd rather pound my head against a wall for hours to find the solution. <br />The only time I had a hint in this course was from a friend for the count change, ""check recursion tree fibonacci"".  Too many classes require only learning a solution and just reapplying it. This course is fun because it is <b><i>slightly </i></b>more challenging! <br /><br />I think it is cool. I have loved this course for that reason, I spent quite some time solving some problems without help. And This is so F*** rewarding! You end up looking at your solution with pride every time you turn on your computer even so it is a 2nd year uni course!<br /><br />But again, I believe your standpoint is very fair too ( hence upvoted ).   <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />",NA,NA,NA

And considering that functional programming is generally not exactly an entry-level topic, I think it makes sense to give tasks that require a little bit more thinking. In fact, as someone here has already mentioned, the exercises are already dumbed-down in the sense that you only have to implement some local functions, never think about the global design of a solution to the problem. So making exercises easier would most likely take away from this course more than it would give.<br />",NA,NA,NA
